    the cart.\n\n"Seriously, Holt! I don''t even know why I bother teaming up with
    you. Look what you did! Now we might have to kill her!\n\n"Don''t you go blaming
    this on me, Whiskers. You''re the one that missed that close range paralysis
    spell just now."\n\n"I swear, if you call me Whiskers one more time..."\n\n"Shut
    your mouth and keep your eyes on the prize. We can still salvage this if we leave
    her unconscious."\n\nThe two mages turn to you.  Now that you are no longer paralyzed
    and looking at the inside of the cart, you can get a clear picture of how the
    mages look. Their skin is dark and their heads are bald, while their garments
    could be accurately described as rags with jewels. They must be mercenaries from
    the southern continent. Those kinds of clothes are usually worn as protection
    from the hot desert sun.\n\n '

  text: 'The girl has now been sleeping for a good number of hours. You''ve since
    moved her body away from the clearing where you''d fought the monsters and into
    the forest, to protect her from the relentless heat of the summer sun.  As you
    lay down with your back against an old oak tree, you ponder what your next course
    of action should be.\n\nNow that you are awakened, you can no longer leave the
    girl''s body, and what''s more, killing her mental projection while your two
    souls are linked would greatly risk killing you as well in the process. As far
    as you know, there is no way to unlink two souls once they''ve been linked, although
    admittedly, your knowledge on this subject has always been limited. There are
    old tomes in the city of Olmnar that cover the subject of soul linking quite
    extensively. Sadly, entering the city as a banshee would be nothing short of
    suicide.\n\nAt any rate, from what you could gather from your little adventure
    this morning, the girl, for whatever reason, does not seem to have any intention
    of hurting you, nor of chasing you out of her body. More than that, she has proven
    to be very competent in a fight, and has magic power that rivals yours, so she
    poses no risk of holding you back in terms of combat. For all of your bad luck
    during this awakening, you console yourself with the fact that your situation
    could have been much, much worse.\n\nAs you sit there meditating, the girl starts
    to wake up, slowly, and once she opens her eyes, she starts watching you intently,
    not saying a word.\n\nPerhaps she expects you to say something?\n\n '

  text: 'If you can''t just leave peacefully then you will need to fight your way
    out. All you need is to create an opening, and you will use that to escape. You
    already know the girl can use short range teleportation here, so there''s no
    use in trying any sort of projectile magic attacks.  You decide to use a water
    trap, a kind of attack that quickly envelops the enemy in a sphere full of water,
    in an attempt to drown them.\n\nBefore the girl can react, water comes from every
    direction and forms into a sphere around her. She shouldn''t be able to escape
    from this; the sphere is too large to teleport out of, and she''s already too
    busy trying to breathe. You doubt this will kill her off, but if nothing else,
    it should provide you with enough time to make your escape.\n\nYou begin to head
    towards the exit, but before even taking the first step, the girl casually evaporates
    your entire water sphere with a big burst of fire, shot in every direction.\n\nOf
    course... Of course she would have magic as well. You''ve already inhabited her
    body for 2 weeks. You did not know about this because you''ve been in a dormant
    state for all this time.  Some of your magic power must have rubbed off on her,
    and the magic''s nature is attuned to her personality. Fire. Out of all the magic
    powers out there, it had to be fire.\n\nThe girl is now squeezing the water out
    of her hair and dress. "Heeeey! Look what you did! Now my hair is all wet!" she
    says in a childlike disgruntled voice.\n\n"Good grief!" you find yourself saying.
    "You have fire magic! Use it to dry your damn hair."\n\n"By the gods, you are
    right!"  the girl exclaims as she conjures up a flame orb that carefully circles
    around her hair, so as to not set it ablaze.\n\nAs the girl is drying her hair
    you stop to consider what the hell you are doing, casually giving the girl advice
    instead of making a run for it. As you make for the exit, the girl calls out
    to you.\n\n"I wouldn''t go out there if I were you!"\n\n '

  text: You decide to answer the girl's question and buy some time in order to find
    out just what exactly is happening.\n\n"I have no name. I am a banshee," you
    explain to her.\n\nThe girl sits there and blinks at you with a puzzled expression
    on her face.\n\n"How can you not have a name?" she asks. "What do people call
    you if you don't have a name?"\n\n"People don't call me anything," you tell her,
    bluntly. "I never talk to them."\n\nThe girl appears shocked. "But then, don't
    you feel lonely?" she asks you, concerned.\n\nLonely. Is this supposed to be
    a human thing?\n\n"I don't know what that means." you tell her, starting to get
    annoyed. The girl mistakes your statement for an invitation to explain the term
    to you.\n\n"Loneliness is that feeling you have when you have no one to talk
    to when you're sad, and no one to help you when you're in trouble."\n\nUninterested
    to hear a thesis about the unnatural human need for socialization, you interrupt
    the girl to ask her about something a bit more relevant to your situation.\n\n"How
    are you here?" you ask the girl.\n\n"Pardon?"\n\n"How are you here, in this place?
    You shouldn't be able to materialize here."\n\n"This is my own mind. Where else
    would I be?"\n\n"This is not what I'm asking.  I've done this possession thing
    dozens of times before, and I've never encountered any sort of resistance. You
    almost had me dragged out of your mind, and then you appeared here, in front
    of me, like it's perfectly normal."\n\n"I'm sorry you almost got dragged out...
    It wasn't intentional."\n\nShe pauses.\n\n"You are the one that gave me all these
    magic powers aren't you? You are the cause for all of these fire powers that
    I suddenly started having..."\n\n"Your magic is... a side effect, of me invading
    your mind. You have magic because I have magic. Although my magic is water. The
    fact that you can control fire and not water is probably a result of you having
    a different personality than mine. Water users are usually more calm and rational,
    whereas fire users tend to be more short-tempered and energetic.\n\nThe girl
    grins.\n\n"I think we need to continue our conversation some other time," she
    interjects.\n\n

    on it, then let''s start with suppressing our magic powers."\n\nThe two of you
    find a secluded spot, far away from the place where you''ve encountered the caravan.
    You practice suppressing your powers for the remainder of the day, and half of
    the night. You are quite impressed with your results. You think most commoners
    should no longer identify the girl as a banshee. There is room left for improvement,
    since a trained mage would still be able to sense her magic aura, but at least
    walking through a city should be much easier now.\n\nAll of that hard training
    has left the both of you exhausted, so you decide it is time to call it a day.
    You cast a rudimentary movement detection spell to awake you in case monsters
    approach your location, and you go to sleep in a nearby cave.\n\n '

    appears right in front of you, and casts a paralysis spell towards you. You manage
    to jump out of its way, but before you even get to land, the mage throws a dagger
    towards you, that hits you right in the chest. The pain is excruciating. You
    knew something like this would happen eventually. So, why didn''t you learn magic
    armor when you had the chance?\n\n"Paralysis," says Holt, the invisible mage.
    Unable to dodge, you take the full blow of his paralysis spell. For some reason,
    however, instead of getting paralyzed, you sense a tremendous electric shock
    travel throughout your body, as if you had just been struck by lightning. You''re
    not going to make it out of this alive, you realize. Already, you are starting
    to lose your consciousness.\n\n"HOLT! Tell me you didn''t just shoot her with
    a paralysis spell before removing that dagger!"\n\n"So what if I did?"\n\n"Don''t
    you even know how paralysis works? The spell uses electricity, and it''s very
    precise. You can''t just use that spell while she has a big steel dagger in her!
    You might as well blast her with a lightning spell, for all the difference it
    would make. I swear, if you were any more stupid than this, I would have to water
    you twice a day---"\n\nAs your consciousness fades, the last thing you hear is
    the sound of the two banshee hunters, still bickering.\n\n '

  text: 'You wake up to the sound of wooden wheels against a rocky path. You try
    to look around, but you realize you are completely paralyzed. From what you can
    make out, you are in a cart, being pulled by a donkey. You can hear two sets
    of footsteps marching alongside the cart. It doesn''t take you long to realize
    you''ve been captured.\n\nYou were careless. You only accounted for monsters,
    but mages could bypass a movement detection spell easily. But how did they find
    you so fast?\n\nYou realize they must be banshee hunters. They have a technique
    that allows them to detect banshees from miles away. Taking measures against
    banshee hunters used to be your second nature. What happened to you? Has it really
    been that long since you''ve possessed a human?\n\nYou look towards the girl''s
    projection in her inner mind. She is sound asleep.\n\n"Girl! Wake up! We''ve
    been captured by banshee hunters!"\n\n"I''m not sleeping! I''m playing dead!"\n\n"You''ve
    been paralyzed, you fool! Playing dead is the only thing you CAN do."\n\n"Shush!
    I''m trying to concentrate! I read in a book that if you''re in trouble and you
    play dead, predators will leave you alone!"\n\nAmusingly enough, the girl, in
    her stupidity has given you an idea. Long ago, you''ve learned a technique that
    could separate your soul from your body. It was invaluable for scouting, especially
    when you needed to see through walls, but it left your body vulnerable, and it
    took a long while to regain control of it afterwards. Furthermore, you could
    not hold the technique for more than half an hour, and if even the slightest
    harm were to come to the body while you were away, your soul would become forever
    lost in the mists of the Soul Plane, doomed to never again be joined with another
    body.\n\nIt would be a risky gamble, but the benefit would be that the body would
    appear as a lifeless husk while your soul is away. Few people know this technique
    even exists, so it would just seem as if you died from a badly executed paralysis
    spell. The two men are close enough to you to notice when you suddenly stop breathing,
    lose your pulse and your body becomes cold. Banshee hunters generally get employed
    by white mages to bring them banshees alive in order to purify them, so they
    would have no use for a dead banshee.\n\nThe girl''s soul would need to be out
    of the body as well, for the technique to have the desired effect, but you should
    be able to guide her spirit out without much trouble.\n\nAnother thing you could
    try would be to focus all of your magical energy to give your muscles a powerful
    jolt. Forcefully removing a paralysis spell this way would however risk generating
    side effects. Controlling the body immediately after performing such a maneuver
    would be extremely difficult and would highly depend on the effectiveness of
    the jolt and on your coordination of movements with the girl.\n\nUsing your water
    or fire magic to attack the two mages is not an option in your current paralyzed
    state.\n\n '

    concentrate.\n\n"Petal?"\n\n You close your eyes and try to visualize the jet
    of water. You realize you will need two of them to keep your balance. You take
    control of the girl''s body, you point her hands towards the ground and prepare
    to launch the jets.\n\n"Petal, what are you doing?"\n\nYou ignore the girl and
    launch your two jets of water, propelling yourself upwards. The guards try to
    cut you off but they don''t time their slashes properly. You are now one hundred
    feet in the air, far away from the guards, losing your momentum and starting
    to fall.\n\n"Petal, what did you do?!?"\n\n"Girl, if you don''t shut up and let
    me concentrate you''re going to end up with two broken legs."\n\nAs you approach
    the ground, you launch two new jets from your hands, slowing you down and breaking
    your fall. You land swiftly on your feet, without sustaining any casualty. Your
    heart is racing. You made it. You were flying. It was exhilarating.\n\nWhile
    the girl recovers from the shock, you look around to see what the situation is.
    The guards are rushing towards you, but they''ve lost their tactical advantage.
    You should easily be able to dispatch them now, using your jets of water and
    the girl''s fireballs.  You might even have a chance to capture the carriage,
    if you play your cards right.  Alternatively, you could take advantage of the
    situation, and keep them at bay until you can retreat back into the forest. Their
    main goal is guarding their merchandise, so they likely won''t pursue you any
    further.\n\n '

    the water yet again and starts laughing cheerfully.\n\n"Alright!" the girl exclaims.
    "We''ll do things your way! Let''s play!"\n\nShe makes a fireball with her hands,
    and throws it at you. You immediately make a spinning pillar of water in front
    of you to take the blow. The fireball explodes in the middle of the pillar and
    sends water splashing in all directions, making it rain all over the place. The
    girl is now dancing in the rain, laughing joyfully.  Somehow, the way she seems
    to be taking this life and death struggle as some sort of a game ticks you off
    even more, and you make an enormous water serpent that you send off to attack
    her. The girl has now stopped dancing, and seems to be taking this a bit more
    seriously all of a sudden. She concentrates a huge amount of magic power around
    herself, her eyes turn crimson red and a giant fire dragon appears in front of
    her. The dragon and the flying serpent engage in battle for what seems to be
    an eternity . You and the girl seem to be evenly matched in skill and magical
    prowess and neither of you is backing down, or making any mistakes. Eventually,
    the two elemental creatures fade into the air and the two of you are both breathing
    hard, as if you have just finished running the marathon. The girl is no longer
    laughing, but she is however smiling. It seems she enjoyed your battle. And even
    though you will not admit it, so did you.  As the girl is gasping for air, she
    looks at you, and points upwards. You look up, but you see nothing. When the
    girl sees you do not understand, she explains: "There''s... trouble upstairs..."'

  text: 'You are a banshee. A being of pure magic. A spirit that needs to inhabit
    other beings'' bodies to survive. Over the years, you''ve taken control of countless
    animals and humans, and left their bodies as they died, only to take control
    of the next one... and then the next one. Over and over again, for decades. Always
    hunted by humans. Always on the run.  For as long as you''ve existed you''ve
    only cared about surviving, and your water magic has been your only true ally.\n\nFor
    the past two weeks, you''ve inhabited the body of a 9 year old human girl. It
    is now time to fully take control of her body and consume her personality, in
    a process that humans have come to call "The banshee awakening". It is not something
    you enjoy doing, but it is something that has to be done. It is the only way
    to keep surviving. With humans especially, it is a matter of "kill or be killed".
    You dwell no longer on this topic and start your way towards the girl''s inner
    mind, the very center of her being.\n\nYou notice something is different this
    time from the hundreds of times you''ve done it in the past. It feels like you
    are swimming against a current, a very strong current, instead of flying through
    a slight breeze.  As you get closer to your destination, the current grows exponentially
    stronger. It is now becoming very difficult to even hold your ground, let alone
    move forward. This has never happened before.\n\nYou start panicking. You can''t
    afford to get thrown out of the body now... There''s just no way you''ll be able
    to find another host in time. You''ll simply fade into non-existence. The mere
    thought terrifies you. You try to muster every little ounce of energy that you
    have left in order to reach the center of the inner mind. It is no use. The current
    has swallowed you and you no longer have the force to fight back. You are being
    dragged towards the outside at a very rapid pace. As you feel like you''re about
    to be thrown out of the body, a hand reaches out to you and pulls you back in. 
    You notice the current has suddenly stopped.\n\nA smiling, cheerful face beams
    at you as you struggle back to your feet. You realize it is the face of the very
    girl you possessed. A sudden feeling of fear and terror engulfs you. Why did
    she pull you out of the current? Does she plan to finish you off here and now
    and make sure you never possess anyone ever again?  How did she even manage to
    materialize herself inside her own mind like this? What kind of superhuman willpower
    has allowed her to fight a banshee within her own mind?\n\nAs you stand there,
    frozen, the girl shows you a big grin and says: "Phew. That was a close one!
    I thought I lost you there. I''m Flower, by the way! Nice to meet you! What''s
    your name?"\n\nYou are unsure how to react to this. The niceness in her tone
    has taken you aback. Does she not know what she''s dealing with? Or is this some
    sort of ploy to get you to lower your guard?  You can''t afford to take the risk.
    As you have learned in the past, humans can be very clever, and are masters of
    deception, even at such a young age. You think about what your options are, at
    this point.\n\nOne option would be to attack her in the hopes you can catch her
    off guard. Your water magic should make short work of her even in the tired state
    you are now, and your magic should work well enough even in this conceptual realm
    you find yourself in. Another option would be to try stalling her by answering
    her question, while trying to find a way to get out of this situation alive.
    Finally you could try fleeing. Even as desperate as this might seem to you now,
    it might be the better option. After all, you have absolutely no idea what you
    are dealing with.'

  text: You suddenly realize you've been so caught up in your duel that you haven't
    checked to see what happened in the real world for a long time. As you direct
    your consciousness towards the outside world, you see that the girl's body is
    floating in the air, with her feet a few centimeters above the ground, her hair
    raised as if there is a source of wind right beneath her, her eyes bright yellow,
    and a very tall spinning pillar of fire and water surrounding her. This is surely
    a side effect of the Awakening not going exactly according to plan.\n\nAll of
    this has apparently also attracted a lot of unwanted attention. While you were
    busy fighting in the girl's mind, several goblins and trolls have surrounded
    you, and are moving cautiously, circling the pillar of flame and water. You also
    spot an ogre magi in the distance, heading back into the forest. Clearly he has
    already satisfied his curiosity by seeing the pillar up close and he has deemed
    it too dangerous to dwell here any longer. Goblins and trolls however generally
    have a much less refined sense of self preservation. They will often let curiosity
    trump their better judgment, and are known to be very vicious creatures. It is
    likely the pillar will not be enough to stop them from killing you, once they
    see it poses no real threat to them.\n\n"We need to... stop the.... pillar before
    we can....start fighting the monsters," the girl says while still catching her
    breath.\n\nShe may be right. That pillar is a result of both of your magic circuits
    going haywire. Controlling either fire or water may prove quite difficult while
    that pillar is still active. However, the time it would take to stop that pillar,
    even if both of you join your powers, will be more than enough for the goblins
    and trolls to go for the kill.\n\n"There is no time," you tell the girl. "Our
    best bet is to try and fight them with our magic while the pillar is active.
    We can take care of the pillar afterwards."\n\n"Don't worry... I can keep a circle
    of fire around us while we stop the pillar. That should keep them away long enough."\n\nShe
    pauses.\n\n"Trust me on this..." she says , as she gives you a pleading look.\n\nIt
    appears she is more than aware of the gravity of this situation. If she can indeed
    hold a wall of fire around the two of you while you stop the pillar of flame
    and water, then this may well be your only viable option to get out of this alive.
    However, that is only IF she can maintain the wall of fire for so long in her
    current condition,  while also concentrating on ending the pillar.\n\n

  text: '"So, what is this idea of yours, then?" you ask the girl.\n\n"We need to
    do some training!"\n\n"Training?... Seriously? That''s your great idea?"\n\n"Nooooo!
    Listen to me! I noticed the magic aura we project towards the outside is weaker
    when I control the body! If we both practice on suppressing it for a few hours,
    I think we might be able to pass as a normal human, as long as I''m the one in
    control! It''s just the magic aura that makes them think I''m a banshee, right?"\n\nThe
    girl seems to be having another one of her sane moments. In reality, the only
    reason people see her as a banshee is because of her magic aura emanating from
    her body. You don''t have to be a mage to sense magic, and it is a well known
    fact that women cannot be born with magic in their veins. The only time a woman
    can obtain magical powers is in the short period between getting possessed by
    a banshee, and the banshee''s awakening.\n\nSome mages possess the ability to
    "purify" a woman that has been possessed by a banshee. The method is primarily
    used by mages who can use white magic (also known as healing magic), and it basically
    consists of killing the banshee, without harming the girl. This method gets harder
    as more time passes since the banshee''s awakening. There are plenty of white
    mages who even pay banshee hunters to capture and bring them banshees, in order
    to purify them.\n\nHumans, however, do not have any means of killing a banshee
    without killing the host in the process. Since mages capable of white magic aren''t
    found around every corner, most people will declare a woman''s life forfeit from
    the moment she''s been possessed by a banshee.\n\n"If we have time to waste on
    learning to suppress our magic aura, then we should be using it on strengthening
    our magic powers," you tell the girl. "Our fights are too risky! Just one false
    step and we would have gotten beheaded back there. If we spend a few hours on
    doing some magic training, I think I might start being able to cast water armor
    on us. We''ll still have the mobility and we''ll no longer be killed in a single
    strike. Plus, I''m pretty sure we can increase our magic power and heighten our
    magic senses too with a bit of practice."\n\n '

    rush towards the golem and use your water whip to keep him at bay, while the
    girl assaults him with a barrage of fire spells. The golem is shouting after
    you constantly with his very loud voice, drowning all other sound around you.
    He seems to be getting more and more tired, as his movements have gotten a lot
    slower than they were at the beginning.\n\n"I think it''s about time we finish
    him off, don''t you think?" you ask the girl.\n\n"Not yet," she answers. "I don''t
    see the other mage, Holt, anywhere."\n\nYou realize she is correct. You haven''t
    seen Holt either, since you started rushing towards his golem friend.\n\n"He
    must have run away at the first sight of danger and left his companion here to
    die," you tell the girl. "His own friend called him useless on several occasions."\n\n"Yes,
    but what if he''s hiding, and waiting for the right moment to lounge at us?"\n\nYou
    look around you. You are in an open field of level ground, with the only trees
    visible being a few miles in the distance. There are no places to hide, yet Holt
    is nowhere in sight. The rock golem is  breathing very heavily now, but he still
    keeps shouting after you.\n\n '

  text: '"The golem may look tough, but in the end he''s just a big pile of rocks,"
    you say. "He can''t cast magic in that form, so we have the upper hand. Let''s
    just blast him with magic until he is forced to come back to his human form."\n\n"Will
    do!" says the girl.\n\nThe two of you focus on using a variety of spells to keep
    the golem at bay. It seems however, that you may have overestimated your magical
    prowess. It may be because you''ve trained your movement coordination instead
    of your magic power yesterday, but your attacks just aren''t strong enough to
    defeat the golem by using brute force.\n\nAs you start thinking that maybe you
    should change your tactics, the golem suddenly rushes to the offensive, with
    a speed you wouldn''t have expected of a creature this size. You try to push
    him back with a powerful jet of water, but the spell doesn''t even slow him down.
    Before you have the time to jump out of his way, the golem grabs a fallen tree
    branch off the ground and uses it to smash your head right in. You barely even
    had the time to feel the pain of it, before your consciousness faded completely.\n\n '

    with a determined look on her face.\n\n"Alright," she says. "Round two! Let''s
    go!"\n\nYou realize she wants to continue your fight from this morning. You are
    currently finding it hard to tell if the girl is being serious, or if she''s
    just joking around, but by this point you''ve pretty much given up trying to
    figure her out.\n\nYou notice that the void which was surrounding you until now
    started taking form. Little by little, different objects start appearing around
    you and before you know it, you find yourself sitting in a room full of toys
    and with detailed mural paintings of knights, castles and dragons. This must
    be a result of the girl waking up. Fascinating.\n\n"I''m not going to fight you,"
    you tell her bluntly. "Our souls have been linked together. If either of us dies
    in here, the victor risks dying as well."\n\n"Oh," the girl says, slightly disappointed.
    "So... Are you going to tell me your name, then?"\n\n"I have no name. I am a
    banshee."\n\n"But... What am I supposed to call you if you don''t have a name?"\n\n"What,
    are you blind and deaf, girl? I just told you I am a banshee. Just call me banshee."\n\n"I
    can''t call you that. It sounds so cold."\n\nShe pauses.\n\n"I know, I''ll call
    you Petal. Flower and Petal, best friends forever!" the girl giggles.\n\n"My
    name is not Petal."\n\n '

  text: '"What are we supposed to do with them if we don''t kill them? We can''t
    just tie them up and leave them here. They''re mages. They''ll escape in no time,
    and come after us again. Banshee hunters have a technique which they use to see
    the trails of magic left behind by banshees. Once they''ve recovered, they''ll
    simply follow the trail back to us and try to catch us unawares."\n\n"We could
    break their legs! They can''t follow us if their legs are broken."\n\nOf all
    the things you would have expected the girl to say in this situation, that was
    not one of them. You can hear Arraka''s muffled laughter from within the amulet.
    You only now realize that you and the girl have been speaking out loud.\n\n"And
    just how did that idea come to you, exactly?"\n\n"I used to belong to a gang
    of hoodlums back in Olmnar. I was one of their pickpockets. Whenever someone
    would make an enemy of the gang, they would break their legs to teach them a
    lesson! There are healers in the city of Olmnar. They''ll have them fixed in
    no time once they''ve crawled back to the city!"\n\nThere''s a continuous mumbling
    sound coming from the amulet. It appears Arraka is trying to say something. You
    open the amulet.\n\n"Hey, little girl," Arraka says. "I think you should break
    their arms too! You can never be too careful!"\n\n"Noooo! We can''t do that!"
    the girl replies. "Then they wouldn''t be able to crawl back to the city!"\n\n"Ooh!
    My bad! It seems you really thought this through! Clever girl!"\n\nThe girl does
    not realize it, but Arraka is in fact being sarcastic.\n\nYou are currently in
    the middle of nowhere. The two banshee hunters must have deliberately taken this
    roundabout path to the city in order to avoid meeting other people. Carrying
    an unconscious little girl in a cart is suspicious, any way you look at it.\n\nAs
    it stands, if you were to break their legs and leave them here, you would practically
    leave them to their deaths. Slow and agonizing deaths. Crawling all the way to
    the city, or even to the main road with both their legs broken would be pretty
    much impossible. The men would most likely die of thirst or of hunger before
    reaching safety.\n\nYou could spare the two men their suffering by leaving two
    delayed water traps hidden below them when you leave. You''ll make sure the girl
    doesn''t notice, and you''ll just tell her you remembered a special knot that
    can hold the two mages for a few days if you tie them up. The traps will trigger
    to impale them straight through the heart once you''re far enough away to be
    out of hearing range, granting them a quick, painless death.\n\nThere is also
    a way you could leave the two men alive without them following you any time soon.
    You''ve once learned a technique that could mess with a person''s magic sense
    temporarily, by applying pressure to certain key points of their body. Arraka
    was in fact the one that taught you this technique. This would keep them out
    of your hair for at least a few days. You would likely have to confront them
    again at a later date, however.\n\n '

  text: 'A pillar of flame and water? Just what kind of nonsense is this girl babbling
    about? You then realize you haven''t checked the outside world for quite a while.
    As you direct your consciousness towards the real world, you see that the girl
    was not lying.\n\nThe girl''s body is floating in the air, with her feet a few
    centimeters above the ground, her hair raised as if there is a source of wind
    right beneath her, her eyes bright yellow, and a very tall spinning pillar of
    fire and water surrounding her. This is surely a side effect of the Awakening
    not going exactly according to plan.\n\nSomething this tall and unordinary is
    sure to catch a lot of unwanted attention. You concentrate on making the pillar
    disappear, but you find that it''s not as easy as it looks.\n\n"Here, I''ll help!"
    the girl says, cheerfully.\n\nIt appears she has finished drying up and is now
    concentrating her magic towards the outside. You decide this is not the time
    for bickering, so you join the girl in concentrating your magic towards the outside
    world, and together you manage to stop the pillar and get the girl''s body back
    to its normal state.\n\nJust as you finish , you start hearing noise coming from
    the woods. Soon after, a few dozens of trolls and goblins start emerging one
    by one from behind the trees. Towering above them all, a hideous creature holding
    a magic staff announces its presence with a bellowing roar. An ogre magi.\n\nThe
    ogre is far more dangerous than all of the goblins and trolls combined. Leaving
    aside its size and strength, the fact that it can cast magic is what worries
    you the most. You look back to see what is the girl''s reaction to all of this.
    You catch her in the middle of some stretching exercises. As she finishes up,
    she puts on a confident grin and says: "I''ll take care of the trolls. I know
    fire will stop them from healing. You take care of the goblins. We can deal with
    the ogre afterwards!"\n\nAs much as you hate taking orders from a little kid,
    her logic is sound, and her plan is exactly what you were about to propose, before
    she beat you to it.\n\n"Very well then," you answer. "Let''s take them all out
    in a single attack."\n\n"Aye, aye, sir!" says the girl, visibly happy to have
    your approval.\n\nYou start attacking the goblins. At first, you try to make
    a huge wave of water to wash them all away, but then you realize that your magic
    is nowhere near as strong here as it is in the conceptual realm. Every time you
    possess a new body it''s the same. It takes a long while for the magic to accommodate
    with your new host. You start attacking them with a rain of water arrows.\n\nAs
    promised, all of the goblins drop dead from your first attack, without any chance
    at retaliation. Looking to your left, it would appear the girl has also upheld
    her end of the bargain, all of the trolls having been killed off by a single
    volley of her fire arrows.\n\nAs you try to move forward, towards the ogre, you
    realize that both you and the girl tried to control the body at the same time,
    resulting in a very awkward movement, ending with the girl falling flat on her
    face.  The girl''s projection inside her mind is now laughing hysterically, unable
    to contain herself.\n\nThe ogre magi is looking very confused. At least that
    little stunt postponed his attack for a while. This shared control of the body
    is not going to cut it. You''ll have to decide which one of you takes control
    of the body, and quick. As if reading your mind, the girl brings forward a suggestion.\n\n"I
    could try and summon a fire wolf to help us. It will take me some time though,
    and you''ll need to control the body in the meantime," she says.\n\nHer plan
    might work, but you are not used to controlling the girl''s movements, and are
    unsure if you could hold the ogre off by yourself long enough for the girl to
    finish her summoning. Alternatively, you could just leave the body''s control
    to the girl, and try to take the ogre down together. Both plans have their faults,
    and you can''t tell which one would give you a better chance of success.\n\n '

  text: '"Very well," you say. "You take control of the body. Once we''ve passed
    through the illusion, we''ll both attack them with everything we''ve got."\n\nThe
    girl nods, curtly. She dashes forward, passing right through the dragon illusion.
    Just as you step out, the illusion fades, and the man with the scythes jumps
    out of the carriage, thrusting his scythes fiercely into the ground. A strong
    electric shockwave knocks you right off your feet, and your head hits the ground
    hard.\n\nAs you try to get up, you realize you''ve been paralyzed. You can''t
    even manage to cast any magic. You turn towards the girl, who is staring forward
    blankly again.\n\n"Girl! Try to see if you can cast any fire magic."\n\nThe girl
    gives no sign of having heard you and continues to stare into nothingness. The
    room, and everything around you has disappeared. All that surrounds you is emptiness.\n\n"Can
    you get the banshee out?" Zalmog, the man with the disc asks the other.\n\n"No,
    too much time has passed since her awakening. She is useless to us. I''ll just
    finish her off."\n\n"Girl! Do you hear me? Girl! ... Flower!!!"\n\nYou feel a
    cold scythe going through your throat as you sit there, powerless. As your consciousness
    fades, you can still see the girl, standing there motionless and expressionless,
    serenely waiting for her impending death.\n\n '

  text: Your instinct tells you that a tactical retreat is probably your safest bet
    at this point. Who knows what the girl has in store for you, should you choose
    to confront her.  Technically, confronting a banshee during her awakening should
    be utterly impossible, so she might be a lot stronger than she lets on. You will
    find another creature to possess. Somehow...\n\nAs you turn your back to the
    girl in order to leave, the girl suddenly appears in front of you and blocks
    your path. So the girl is also capable of teleporting in this place. It seems
    it was a good call not to confront her. You attempt to go around her but she
    sidesteps and blocks you again.  You do this a few more times and she just mimics
    your moves, putting herself between you and the exit. She puts her hands behind
    her back and looks at you, smiling.\n\n"What'cha doin'?" she says, still smiling.\n\n"I'm
    trying to leave. Step aside," you answer her.\n\n"Leave? But where? You have
    nowhere else to go..." the girl says with a concerned voice.  Nowhere else to
    go... She may be right.  And yet...\n\n"This is none of your concern. Get out
    of my way," you reply.\n\nThe girl straightens up, and looks you straight in
    the eye.\n\n"Make me!" she tells you, with a wide grin on her face.\n\nIt's becoming
    clear now that simply leaving is no longer an option.\n\n

    a roar of pain. Holt is still rolling on the floor from the pain but Whiskers
    has regained his composure and is now looking towards you, his face full of rage.\n\n"I''m

    NOT DONE WITH YOU! COME BACK HERE SO I CAN KILL YOU!"\n\nYou turn your head slightly
    towards him.\n\n"You are in no position to make any threats. You should be thankful
    I even left you alive.  Now go and crawl back into whatever pit you came out
    of and never bother me again."\n\nYou can still hear Whiskers swearing and calling
    after you, long after you''ve left the clearing in which you''ve fought. Once
    you''re far enough away from the place where you fought the banshee hunters,
    you turn towards the girl.\n\n"There is an elixir we can drink to avoid being
    tracked by banshee hunters. I used it quite often, back when I possessed my last
    human."\n\nYour head starts spinning. The recent events have left you very tired,
    and you''ve barely managed to sleep before you got captured.\n\n"We''ll discuss

    don''t want any more surprises this time around."\n\n"Sure thing, Petal!"\n\nYou
    never realized how tired you really were until you closed your eyes. As you lay
    down, you fall asleep almost instantly.\n\n '

  text: '"We won''t need to hunt them down," you tell the girl. "I saw something
    fall from their carriage after you sent them flying. They are sure to come back
    for it after they''ve realized it''s gone. We can use it as bait."\n\nThe girl
    seems to really like your plan. She squeals with excitement and then says: "We
    can dig a hole in the ground, cover it up, and then place their cargo on top.
    They''ll never see it coming!"\n\nThe ability of this girl to alternate between
    intelligent, well thought-out plans and this kind of mindless drivel is truly
    astounding. You pay no mind to the girl''s comment and head for the place where
    the cargo was dropped. As you get nearer, you see that what fell from the carriage
    was a golden amulet, with a chain attached to it.\n\nYou take the amulet off
    the ground and open it. Inside it you find a mirror, with a few small diamonds
    surrounding it for decoration. As you gaze into the mirror, your reflection is
    slowly being replaced with a dim green light. The presence emanating from within
    feels very familiar, but you can''t pinpoint exactly what it is.\n\n"Look, Petal.
    It''s one of your sisters!"\n\nIt doesn''t take you long to realize that the
    girl is right. Although how those mages were able to trap a banshee inside an
    amulet you could not say. The green light starts to speak. Its voice is very
    weak, and resembles that of a small human girl.\n\n"Please," the light says.
    "You need to help me. I''ve been trapped in here for so long. Please. You need
    to set me free."\n\n"Who are you?" you ask the other banshee. "How did you end
    up captured?"\n\n"I am Anyad. They captured me while I was hunting for game in
    the nearby forest. They were so strong. I couldn''t fight them."\n\n"Wait a minute,"
    the girl says, turning to you. "You told me banshees don''t have names!"\n\n"I
    lied."\n\n"Heeeeeeey!"\n\nYou ignore the girl and continue to question the banshee.\n\n"Where
    were they taking you?"\n\n"They said they were heading for Olmnar. I wasn''t
    the only one taken. A lot of us were in that carriage. Please, I feel myself
    fading away. You have to set me free. I promise I will answer all of your questions
    afterwards. All you need to do is break the mirror inside this amulet."\n\n"She
    sounds so weak," the girl tells you. "Maybe we should release her..."\n\n"Girl,
    I have met dozens of banshees in my time. And I assure you none of them could
    be trusted."\n\n"But she''s just a small child. I don''t think she''d harm us.
    And besides, we can just fight her if she attacks us, right? There''s two of
    us and one of her."\n\nYou pause for a bit, to take the girl''s words into consideration.\n\n"Please,"
    the green light speaks again. "I am running out of time..."\n\n '

  text: '"Wait, are those guards over there still alive? You''re getting soft, Illuna.
    Didn''t our time together teach you anything?"\n\n"Illuna?" the girl asks Arraka.
    "Is that her name? She never wanted to tell me her name. I don''t know why. It
    sounds wonderful!"\n\n"Sounds wonderful? Illuna did you hear that? The poor girl
    doesn''t know why you wouldn''t tell her your name! Aha- AHAHAHAHAHA---"\n\nYou
    close the amulet and shut her up. You''ve had enough of her insufferable sense
    of humor for one day.\n\n"Petal?" the girl asks you.\n\n"I''m not in the mood
    to talk about this, girl."\n\n"No, I won''t call you Illuna if you don''t want
    to... I just wanted to ask you a few questions about the Still Winter. You and
    Arraka were talking about the Magium, and stillwaters and Ancients, but I''ve
    never heard of any of those things. Can you please tell me what they are?"\n\nYou
    sigh. At this point you are willing to tackle just about any subject that isn''t
    directly related to your past.\n\n"Okay. Pay attention, because I''m only going
    to say this once, and I''m going to be very short. The Magium is the source of
    all the magic in the world. That is where mages draw their magic from, and where
    all banshees are born.\n\nThe stillwaters are a very powerful and unique breed
    of mages. They were slaves of the Ancients, hundreds of years ago, but they managed
    to rebel against their masters with the aid of a spirit golden fox and a stillwater
    that has later come to be known as the Creator. The rebellion of the stillwaters
    started the Still Winter, but the stillwaters went too far.\n\nThe Creator and
    the spirit golden fox put an end to it by defeating the other stillwaters and
    used the power of the Magium to forbid Arraka to ever possess another human being
    again. The Creator and the fox then created all of the cities on this continent
    and named our continent Varathia, meaning freedom in the ancient language."\n\n"But
    then, if Arraka can''t possess human beings, why did she try to take over my
    body? Is it because you''re here with me?"\n\n"Yes and no. Normally it is not
    possible for a banshee to invade a body that''s already been taken by another
    banshee. The reason she could do it was because of our soul fusion. The Magium
    no longer sees the two of us as separate entities, which creates a loophole that
    Arraka can use to her advantage. The Creator and the spirit fox must have overlooked
    this possibility, as they didn''t think it possible for anyone other than Arraka
    to ever fuse with a human soul.\n\nGetting back to your original question, I
    still haven''t told you about the Ancients. The Ancients were a very proud race,
    and they ruled most of the continent, before the rebellion. They could not cast
    magic naturally, but were very skilled at creating powerful magical artifacts
    which they''d use to oppress the other mages. They even used to say they were
    more powerful than the sun itself and had a banner with ...  "\n\nYou suddenly
    remember the two mages you fought and the brooches they wore, with the hawk holding
    the sun in its talons. It''s been so long since you''ve seen that depiction that
    you''d almost forgotten.\n\n"...with a hawk holding the sun in its talons," you
    continue. "In fact, the two gentlemen we''ve fought a few minutes ago were most
    likely remnants of this long forgotten race. You will still see some of them
    scattered here or there, trying in vain to restore their race''s former glory."\n\nYou
    are not sure exactly how much the girl understood of your historical lecture,
    but at least it made her shut up for the time being.\n\n"Now come, let us waste
    no more time in this place."\n\n"Hold on, Petal! We still need to do something
    about people attacking us on sight, or we''ll never get anywhere! We can''t just
    keep avoiding people for the rest of our lives."\n\n '

    planning on taking you all the way to Olmnar. Those mages wouldn''t have risked
    you dying on the way there with all of the precautions they took to guard their
    precious cargo. So, which is it then?"\n\n"It must be because you opened the
    amulet ahead of time. Please, you have to help me!"\n\nAs she speaks, her voice
    is fluctuating in intensity. It could be an effect of the amulet. But it could
    also be the mark of her being a very, very old spirit. Hundreds of years old.
    Very few banshees ever make it past one hundred years of age, as they are constantly
    being hunted down by humans. A banshee that would have survived so much time
    would need to be immensely powerful.\n\nOf all the banshees you have encountered
    and heard of in your lifetime, only one of them could fit that description. A
    sudden chill runs through you. Could it be?...\n\n"Anyad, I believe you," you
    tell the green light. "But first, I need to make sure you won''t betray us once
    you''ve gotten out of your little shell."\n\n"I would never do such a thing!"
    she says in an innocent voice.\n\n"I have no doubts. But, just to make sure,
    I''d like you to recount the events of the Still Winter for me."\n\n"The events
    of the Still Winter?"\n\n"Yes. Surely, you must know of it? All banshees have
    the knowledge of these events engraved into their minds even from before they
    are separated from the Magium."\n\n"Yes.. Yes.. of course I know of it... It
    was the most horrible massacre in the history of our continent. The stillwaters...
    they killed everyone in their path. They left no animal or child alive. They
    hungered for revenge against their oppressors, but they made no distinction between
    the Ancients and ordinary humans. They would kill anyone that got in their way.
    In only a few weeks they had leveled half of the continent, and all they left
    in their wake was a frozen wasteland. Their leaders..." she pauses.\n\n"Go on,"
    you urge her.\n\n"Their leaders were a banshee and a stillwater, fused together,
    in the same body. Together they would cause unspeakable horrors. They would behead
    all of their victims, and then they''d...and then they''d deliver their heads
    to their families in... in... neatly wrapped gift packaHAHAHAHAHAHAH"\n\nThe
    green light''s voice had now completely changed from that of an innocent child,
    to three different voices laughing simultaneously. Her laugh was uncontrollable,
    as much as she had tried to hold it in. You look at her, disgusted.\n\n"What''s
    happening? Why is she laughing?" the girl asks you, confused.\n\n"She''s laughing
    because she was the banshee in her story. Her real name is Arraka, not Anyad,
    and she is well known for her uncontrollable laughs when she remembers her own
    atrocities."\n\nYou turn to the girl. "Girl, we were lucky I managed to figure
    her out in time. If she got out of there, it wouldn''t have been a matter of
    two versus one. She would have obliterated us in the blink of an eye, and she
    would have taken this body to commit more of her horrors."\n\nYou look towards
    the amulet with contempt as you leave it on the ground and turn to leave. The
    banshee in the amulet has suddenly stopped laughing and is calling after you,
    with a frightened tone in her voice.\n\n"No, wait... I''m sorry I tried to trick
    you. I can help you. Don''t leave me here!"\n\n"And how exactly is it that you
    can help us while inside that amulet? Unless you actually expect us to be dumb
    enough to set you free?"\n\n"I know where they''re taking all of the other banshees.
    I know the location of the headquarters of the mages that captured me. And I
    know for a fact that their headquarters is full of very strong magical artifacts."\n\nPerhaps
    even artifacts strong enough to separate your soul from that of the girl''s.\n\n"How
    do we know you''re not trying to lead us into a trap?" you ask Arraka.\n\n"I
    don''t have any allies in the city. You should know that much. I''d rather be
    your prisoner than a lab rat for the people that trapped me in this amulet."\n\nThe
    fear in her voice seems sincere this time around. You do not think she has any
    reason to lie to you at this point.\n\n '

    one big water and fire beam to shoot towards them. You release the beam just
    as they turn to you, and right before it reaches them, the man named Whiskers
    transforms himself into a 9 foot tall rock golem, places himself in front of
    Holt, and takes your attacks head on. He appears to have taken quite a bit of
    damage, but he is standing his ground.\n\n"We''re not salvaging anything, Holt,"
    says Whiskers in a loud, hoarse voice. "That banshee can somehow control fire
    and water at the same time. I''m killing her now, before she pulls some other
    ace out of her sleeve."\n\nWhiskers digs his hands into the ground, and pulls
    out a huge rock that he throws your way. You manage to get out of its way just
    in time and send another barrage of attacks towards them. The rock golem mage
    barely manages to block all of the attacks, with his bare body, but he does not
    move from his position.\n\n"Holt, you useless sack of crap, stop hiding behind
    me and do something!"\n\nNow that the two mages are on the defensive, you need
    to decide how you''re going to attack them. One way would be to blast them with
    all of the magic spells you can think of and rely on your superior mastery of
    the magical elements. Another way would be to rely on the girl''s acrobatic skills
    to try and outmaneuver the golem, and find his weak point.\n\n '

  text: 'You try to jump backwards, but you don''t manage to fully get in control
    of the body, and end up tripping over your own feet, falling right on your back.
    Two guards take advantage of the situation and lounge straight at you, swords
    in hand. Out of reflex, you put your hands in front of you and shoot two powerful
    jets of water, knocking the guards back.\n\nYou quickly get back to your feet
    and look for an opening. The guards now have you completely surrounded. The girl
    still hasn''t regained her common sense, and is asking you, confused: "What''s
    happening? Why are they attacking us?"\n\n"What did you expect? People see you
    as a banshee now. Banshees get attacked on sight. Your life among humans is over.
    Snap out of it and fight, or we''re both going to die."\n\n"Oooh. Now I get it!"
    the girl exclaims, as she gets into her battle stance and regains her usual smirk.\n\nTaking
    a good look at the guards, you see that they are well equipped to defend against
    magic attacks. They are covered from head to toe with anti-magic armor. This
    is obviously not your everyday merchant caravan. They must be guarding something
    very important.\n\nYou quickly evaluate your available tactics. Anti-magic armor
    is good against direct magical attacks such as fire and water arrows, but impact
    spells such as fireballs and your water jets should easily send them flying. 
    Judging by their equipment, the guards may well be elite soldiers, however. If
    they are, then you wouldn''t stand a chance against them with such crude tactics,
    while they have you surrounded.\n\nGiven that they do not seem to have any ranged
    attackers in their midst, a good idea may be to surround yourself with whirlpools,
    and snipe them at your leisure.\n\nYou could also try launching yourself into
    the air with a jet of water from beneath your feet. You''ve never really attempted
    the move before, and risk breaking your legs when you land if you don''t quickly
    launch another jet to break your fall, but if it works, you wouldn''t end up
    being trapped between a dozen soldiers and your own whirlpools.\n\n '

  text: "This is the end of what the author has written.\\n\\nMy suggestion here
    is that the community continues this story and the original, along with the Eiden
    prequel.\\n\\nAnd if the community wishes, I would love to continue being on
    the coding team of the game if it does continue. I made the game in Unity, for
    anyone wondering, and here is the Github link for the project, you are free to
    use it however you want:\\n\\nIf someone wants to not use Unity, and use a framework
    say in C++, I can still help as I have a bit of experience in C++ (I mainly did
    work toying around in Vulkan for rendering).\\n\\nIf the community wants it to
    continue in Unity (as it\u2019s my area of most comfort), I would be happy to
    share the repository that I am working on, Unity allows up to 3 people (on my
    current license which is Personal) to join.\\n\\nAlso I have tried to make it
    as fast as possible to allow people to enter text for the story. I made the project
    in such a way in which people don\u2019t need to enter code (though I will have
    to show whoever wants to use it how to as it\u2019s a little confusing at first).
    However I wouldn\u2019t mind continuing to port documents into the project if
    the project is continued.\\n\\nAnd as for the main App of Magium, if the community
    wishes, I can port that over into a new app since I saw the author\u2019s brother
    did want it ported if they managed to open source it. I will make a webGL build
    from Unity for someone to make a website for as the author\u2019s brother requested,
    so if anyone is willing to build a website and incorporate the build into it
    you may take that build.\\n\\nReport any bugs you find directly to me on the
    original post I made about this app on reddit.\\n\\nIn case I don\u2019t respond
    within a day ping me on the discord server (it\u2019s the same as my reddit name
    without the numbers). I do have school so unless its holiday you may have to
    wait until the weekend depending on how busy I am.\\n\\nThank you and have a
    good day :D!\\n\\n\\ "

  text: '"Very well. Let''s go with your plan, then," you say, reluctantly.\n\nThe
    girl beams at you and says: "Aye, aye, sir!" while making a circle of fire to
    shelter you from the troll and goblin attacks.\n\nThe fire wall around you is
    quite impressive in size, and the monsters have taken a step back, too afraid
    to advance into the flames.  You both start to concentrate on stopping the pillar.
    As she starts concentrating her power on the pillar, she almost drops off her
    feet but then gets back up.\n\nAs you look at her, she says: "I''m fine... Keep
    going..."\n\nHer wall of fire is barely holding up, but it''s still doing its
    job of keeping the monsters well away from the girl''s body. After what seemed
    to take forever, you finally managed to stop the pillar, and bring the girl''s
    body back to its normal state. The girl, on the other hand, dropped off her feet,
    and it looks like she''s making an effort to keep her consciousness.\n\nYou realize
    you could probably easily take her out now, and gain full control of her body.
    Killing the goblins and trolls afterwards should be a piece of cake. She is however
    in such a state as a result of saving your life, as well as hers. As much as
    it would benefit you to finish her off, you cannot bring yourself to do it.\n\n"I''ll
    take it from here," you tell the girl.\n\n"Roger..." she answers you with an
    exhausted smile on her face.\n\nYou start attacking the monsters. At first, you
    try to make a huge wave of water to wash them all away, but then you realize
    that your magic is nowhere near as strong here as it is in the conceptual realm.
    Every time you possess a new body it''s the same. It takes a long while for the
    magic to accommodate with your new host. You start attacking them with a rain
    of water arrows.\n\nMost of the goblins are killed by your first attack. The
    trolls , on the other hand have mostly risen back to their feet, as they''ve
    already healed their wounds. You forgot about this. The trolls have a very high
    regenerative ability that makes most attacks against them useless. Most attacks...
    but not fire. You look towards the girl. She is still not back on her feet. You
    take care of the remaining goblins and start concentrating on the trolls.\n\nThe
    only thing that would work on the trolls in order to kill them before they regenerate
    is to decapitate them on the spot. Your magic is not strong enough to be able
    to use the water whip at this point. You try to think of other attacks that could
    decapitate a troll instantly, but you can''t use any of them at your current
    level of power. You try to hold the trolls off with another rain of water arrows,
    but it''s only delaying them. They''re still advancing, and none of them are
    dying.\n\nAs you are keeping the trolls at bay with your volleys of water arrows,
    you see a few fire arrows fly past your head and right into the heads of some
    of the trolls. They all died almost instantly.\n\nYou look back at the girl.\n\n"Try
    to ... keep them at a distance..." the girl says as she struggles to form a sentence.
    "I ... can''t use ... many of these... at once."\n\n"I understand," you tell
    the girl as you shift your tactic to try and delay instead of kill the trolls.
    You create a few whirlpools of water right in front of the trolls. The monsters
    are unsure what to do. One of them tries to go through a whirlpool and gets caught
    in the current. Seeing what happened to their brother in arms, the rest of the
    trolls are reluctant to advance any further. The girl is now free to take the
    trolls out at her leisure.\n\nAs more and more trolls are being finished off,
    the remainder of them try to make for a tactical retreat. You anticipated this,
    and created whirlpools all around them .  Some of the trolls try jumping into
    the whirlpools, while others have given up and silently await their execution.
    In the end, all of them are dead, and no survivors are left to call for backup.\n\nYou
    look at the girl again, and she gives you a tired but victorious smile. With
    the last of her powers, she says: "We did it!" before she faints.\n\nAs you look
    at her peaceful expression while sleeping, it dawns on you that you have already
    awakened.  It took you so long to realize it because it''s never happened this
    way before. For some reason, this time you have fused with the girl''s soul instead
    of taking full control of her body. Once the process of the awakening is done,
    it cannot be undone, which means there is no way for you to leave the body for
    a good number of years. If the girl dies, you die with her.\n\nIt appears that
    the two of you will be stuck together for a while.\n\n '

  text: '"Start summoning the wolf," you announce the girl. "I will try to delay
    the ogre for as long as I can."\n\n"I''m on it!" says the girl, as her eyes turn
    crimson red and she enters a summoning trance.\n\nYou look towards the ogre,
    and wait to see what his first move is.  Seeing that you are not taking the offensive,
    the monster initiates by throwing a big boulder towards you. The boulder is too
    big to be able to deflect it with any of your available water spells, but luckily
    the boulder came from far enough that you had time to dodge it clumsily, by jumping
    to your left.\n\nSince your primary objective is to delay the ogre, and not defeat
    him, you make sure to keep your distance, as you attempt to distract him by sending
    a few water hawks his way. The ogre sees the birds, and smacks his staff against
    the ground, which causes a pillar of stone to rise from the ground and obliterate
    your poor hawks.\n\nSo he is using earth magic, then. That is good to know. His
    staff should not give him sufficient range to reach you with his spells. As long
    as he keeps hurling boulders you can just keep dodging them. You take a few steps
    back, to make sure you keep as much of a distance as possible between you and
    the ogre.\n\nGleaning your true intentions, the ogre smashes his staff against
    the ground yet again, this time raising a stone platform from beneath his feet,
    and making it float a few centimeters above the ground. Standing on the platform,
    he uses it to travel towards you at great speed. You cannot allow the ogre to
    reach you with that staff. There is no way you can beat him alone with your current
    magic power. You aim a strong jet of water towards the ogre, which knocks him
    off his platform. The platform crashes into the ground and sends a few rocks
    flying your way, which you manage to dodge in time.\n\nAs the ogre gets back
    to his feet, you notice that the girl has finished her incantation, and has summoned
    her fire wolf. The beast is far larger than an average wolf, being almost the
    same size as the ogre.  It seems the girl went all out with this spell of hers.\n\nThe
    wolf growls and rushes towards the ogre, as the latter readies his staff once
    more. You prepare to assist the wolf, but the girl stops you and says, smiling:
    "Don''t worry, he''s got this!"\n\nAs you watch the battle between the wolf and
    the ogre, you start to understand what the girl means. The ogre is clearly no
    match for the wolf. He has completely forgotten about you, and is desperately
    trying to smash the wolf between slates of rock. The wolf effortlessly jumps
    away from all of the ogre''s magic attacks, and pounces right on the monster,
    burning him with fire claws and fangs. In the end, only ashes remain of the ogre
    and his staff. The wolf gives off a final victorious howl, as he vanishes into
    the wind.\n\nAs the battle ends, the girl smiles triumphantly and says: "Ha-haa!
    We did it! Yay us!"\n\nBefore giving you the time to reply, she looks at you
    and says: "This battle really wore me out... I need a nap. Wake me up if you
    see any more ogres, ok?" and almost instantly goes to sleep, as you watch her,
    incredulous.\n\nYou cannot tell if she is being really stupid or really ignorant
    for going to sleep next to a banshee that invaded her own mind and was trying
    to consume her personality just a few moments ago , but even though you know
    it would bring you great benefit to finish her off here and now, you find that
    you just cannot bring yourself to do it.\n\nAs you look at her peaceful expression
    while sleeping, it dawns on you that you have already awakened.  It took you
    so long to realize it because it''s never happened this way before. For some
    reason, this time you have fused with the girl''s soul instead of taking full
    control of her body. Once the process of the awakening is done, it cannot be
    undone, which means there is no way for you to leave the body for a good number
    of years. If the girl dies, you die with her.\n\nIt appears that the two of you
    will be stuck together for a while.\n\n '

  text: '"I don''t think they''ll be able to make it back to safety with their legs
    broken, girl. I have another idea. I know a pressure point technique that can
    mess with their magic senses temporarily. They won''t be able to track us for
    the next few days. That should allow us enough time to distance ourselves from
    them."\n\nYou haven''t used this technique in a while, but these are not the
    kinds of things you easily forget. You place your palm on Holt''s chest. You
    close your eyes, and try to visualize his magic circuits, and their extremities.
    You identify all of the pressure points you need, and hit them briefly, in succession,
    with all of your fingers close together. As you hit the last pressure point,
    you can sense Holt''s magic aura reverse its flow. This is your confirmation
    that your technique was successful. You do the same for Whiskers. The two men
    remain unconscious as you perform your technique.\n\n"It is done," you tell the
    girl. "Now let''s get out of here. I''ve had enough of this place."\n\nAs you
    head into the forest, you take one last look at the two banshee hunters, and
    realize you probably haven''t seen the last of them yet.\n\nOnce you''re far
    enough away from the place where you fought the banshee hunters, you turn towards
    the girl.\n\n"There is an elixir we can drink to avoid being tracked by banshee
    hunters. I used it quite often, back when I possessed my last human."\n\nYour
    head starts spinning. The recent events have left you very tired, and you''ve
    barely managed to sleep before you got captured.\n\n"We''ll discuss this at a
    later time, though. For now, I need to sleep. Can you keep watch? I don''t want
    any more surprises this time around."\n\n"Sure thing, Petal!"\n\nYou never realized
    how tired you really were until you closed your eyes. As you lay down, you fall
    asleep almost instantly.\n\n '

    pillar in your current condition," you tell the girl. "I''m starting to attack
    the goblins. You take care of the trolls. Fire should counter their regenerative
    abilities."\n\n"Ok... I''m on it," she says, disappointed.\n\nYou start attacking
    the goblins. At first, you try to make a huge wave of water to wash them all
    away, but then you realize that your magic is nowhere near as strong here as
    it is in the conceptual realm. Every time you possess a new body it''s the same.
    It takes a long while for the magic to accommodate with your new host. You start
    attacking them with a rain of water arrows.\n\nSome of your arrows hit their
    mark, but only a few. Most of them have missed by far. It must be the pillar...
    Your control of the magic is poor, at best. You have no choice but to aim each
    arrow individually. It would seem the girl is not faring any better herself.
    She must have reached the same conclusion as you, as she is aiming individual
    fire arrows for each of the trolls.\n\nThe monsters were retreating at first,
    but when they saw the slow speed at which the two of you dispose of them, they
    started gaining back their courage. They''re now advancing towards you with their
    shields up, blocking most of your attacks. You take a few more of them out, but
    there are way too many. They''re getting closer. They''ve almost reached you...\n\nThe
    girl is now looking at you with a sad smile on her face. "I really enjoyed playing
    with you! I''m sorry you couldn''t bring yourself to trust me...  I wish you
    would have at least told me your name..."\n\n"NO! Don''t stop attacking them--"
    you yell, even though you know it''s much too late.\n\n"Bye..." the girl says,
    right before her outside body gets stabbed by the trolls.\n\nThe last thing you
    see is the girl waving at you while her body dies, and while you yourself fade
    slowly into non-existence.\n\n '

    trying to see how badly the paralysis had affected you. Luckily, the physical
    coordination exercises you did yesterday had paid off. Even with the side effects
    of the paralysis, you feel that you can move at least as good as you did yesterday.\n\n"Girl,
    we''re good to go! Fire everything you''ve got at them!"\n\n"Yes, sir!"\n\nShe
    starts shooting fireballs at them, while you send a jet of water towards each
    of them. Just as your projectiles reach them, the man named Whiskers transforms
    himself into a 9 foot tall rock golem, places himself in front of Holt, and takes
    your attacks head on. Although shaken up a bit, he does not appear to have sustained
    any serious damage.\n\n"We''re not salvaging anything, Holt," says Whiskers in
    a loud, hoarse voice. "That banshee can somehow control fire and water at the
    same time. I''m killing her now, before she pulls some other ace out of her sleeve."\n\nWhiskers
    digs his hands into the ground, and pulls out a huge rock that he throws your
    way. You manage to get out of its way just in time and send another barrage of
    attacks towards them. The rock golem mage barely manages to block all of the
    attacks, with his bare body, but he does not move from his position.\n\n"Holt,
    you useless sack of crap, stop hiding behind me and do something!"\n\nNow that
    the two mages are on the defensive, you need to decide how you''re going to attack
    them. One way would be to blast them with all of the magic spells you can think
    of and rely on your superior mastery of the magical elements. Another way would
    be to rely on the girl''s acrobatic skills to try and outmaneuver the golem,
    and find his weak point.\n\n '

    did you hear that?" Holt asks the other man. "I think it came from the amulet."\n\nHe
    reaches for the amulet and opens it.\n\n"Wait," Arraka blurts out. "The banshee
    isn''t dead! She''s just hiding in the ethereal plane!"\n\n"And just who the
    hell are you?"\n\n"I am Anyad. A spirit of the forest. The banshee trapped me
    in this amulet and has tormented me every day since! Please, the girl that she
    possessed is my friend. You have to help her!"\n\nThe two men exchange looks.\n\n"And
    how exactly are we supposed to get her back into the body? Are we supposed to
    just wait here?"\n\n"No!" Arraka says. "You just need to prick her with a needle.
    Any light wound will do, as long as she draws a bit of blood. The pain will force
    her to come back!"\n\n"Well, it''s worth a shot, I guess," Holt says. "We were
    going to dump her here, anyway."\n\nNO! Just a small prick of that needle will
    make you lose your way forever.  You need to go back, quick. You start heading
    towards the body, pulling the girl after you. As you approach, one of the men
    cuts one of the girl''s fingers, slightly, with his dagger. Suddenly, it feels
    like there are a swarm of bees flying through your head. The sharp pain keeps
    getting more and more intense, and your consciousness starts fading slowly, as
    you and the girl get pulled towards the Soul plane.\n\n"Illuna!" you hear Arraka
    call out to you. "You need to come back to us! I need you... I need you... to
    be safe... AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA---"\n\nThe last thing you hear is Arraka''s laughter
    ringing through your ears, while you are pulled slowly towards the mists of the
    Soul plane, which will become your prison for all eternity.\n\n '

    happening? Why are they attacking us?"\n\n"What did you expect? People see you
    as a banshee now. Banshees get attacked on sight. Your life among humans is over.
    Snap out of it and fight, or we''re both going to die."\n\n"Oooh. Now I get it!"
    the girl exclaims, as she gets into her battle stance and regains her usual smirk.\n\nTaking
    a good look at the guards, you see that they are well equipped to defend against
    magic attacks. They are covered from head to toe with anti-magic armor. This
    is obviously not your everyday merchant caravan. They must be guarding something
    very important.\n\nAnti-magic armor is good against direct magical attacks such
    as fire and water arrows, but impact spells such as fireballs and your water
    jets should easily send them flying.\n\nThe guards have completely abandoned
    their formation and are pretty much scattered by this point. You might even have
    a chance to capture the carriage, if you play your cards right.  Alternatively,
    you could take advantage of the situation, and keep them at bay until you can
    retreat back into the forest. Their main goal is guarding their merchandise,
    so they likely won''t pursue you any further.\n\n '

  text: '"Girl, it''s time you put your money where your mouth is. Show me how good
    your acrobatic skills really are."\n\nThe girl looks happy to be given such a
    task.\n\n"You can count on me, Petal!"\n\nShe starts running around the golem,
    shooting flames high and low, left and right, trying to overwhelm him. The golem
    rushes towards her with a lot more speed than you would have expected from a
    creature of this size, but the girl skips and jumps away from all of his attacks,
    while shooting some more fireballs his way.  You try to assist her by hitting
    the golem with your water spells simultaneously.\n\nThere is something off about
    the girl''s movements though. Most of the golem''s hits are very near misses,
    and it seems that Whiskers is the one leading the battle, not the other way around.
    You realize it must be because you never bothered to train movement coordination
    with the girl. She may look fine, but in reality she is straining her limits.\n\n"Girl,
    maybe we should try to focus on brute force instead of agility."\n\n"It''s ok,
    I can do this!"\n\nThe girl keeps circling around the golem, in an attempt to
    tire him out. She keeps dodging all of his attacks, but with every one of his
    hits, Whiskers appears more confident, and the girl looks more tired. It only
    takes one small blunder on the girl''s part to end the battle. While jumping
    away from one of the golem''s attacks, she does not notice a small rock on the
    ground and trips right over it when she lands. She tries to regain her balance,
    but it''s too late. Whiskers immediately took advantage of the girl''s mistake,
    and landed a full blow, which sent her flying headfirst into a big rock.\n\nEven
    with your magic armor on, the force of the impact was strong enough to crack
    your skull. You barely even had the time to feel the pain of it, before your
    consciousness faded completely.\n\n '

  text: '"What are we supposed to do with them if we don''t kill them? We can''t
    just tie them up and leave them here. They''re mages. They''ll escape in no time,
    and come after us again. Banshee hunters have a technique which they use to see
    the trails of magic left behind by banshees. Once they''ve recovered, they''ll
    simply follow the trail back to us and try to catch us unawares."\n\n"We could
    break their legs! They can''t follow us if their legs are broken."\n\nOf all
    the things you would have expected the girl to say in this situation, that was
    not one of them.\n\n"And just how did that idea come to you, exactly?"\n\n"I
    used to belong to a gang of hoodlums back in Olmnar. I was one of their pickpockets.
    Whenever someone would make an enemy of the gang, they would break their legs
    to teach them a lesson! There are healers in the city of Olmnar. They''ll have
    them fixed in no time once they''ve crawled back to the city!"\n\nYou are currently
    in the middle of nowhere. The two banshee hunters must have deliberately taken
    this roundabout path to the city in order to avoid meeting other people. Carrying
    an unconscious little girl in a cart is suspicious, any way you look at it.\n\nAs
    it stands, if you were to break their legs and leave them here, you would practically
    leave them to their deaths. Slow and agonizing deaths. Crawling all the way to
    the city, or even to the main road with both their legs broken would be pretty
    much impossible. The men would most likely die of thirst or of hunger before
    reaching safety.\n\nYou could spare the two men their suffering by leaving two
    delayed water traps hidden below them when you leave. You''ll make sure the girl
    doesn''t notice, and you''ll just tell her you remembered a special knot that
    can hold the two mages for a few days if you tie them up. The traps will trigger
    to impale them straight through the heart once you''re far enough away to be
    out of hearing range, granting them a quick, painless death.\n\nThere is also
    a way you could leave the two men alive without them following you any time soon.
    You''ve once learned a technique that could mess with a person''s magic sense
    temporarily, by applying pressure to certain key points of their body. This would
    keep them out of your hair for at least a few days. You would likely have to
    confront them again at a later date, however.\n\n'

  text: '"Something''s not right," you tell the girl. "Holt couldn''t have escaped
    in such a short time, yet he''s nowhere to be seen. Let''s back up for a bit."\n\nAs
    you back up, Whiskers is still shouting at you and tries to follow you, but he
    can barely move anymore.\n\n"And why has this buffoon been shouting at us ever
    since the beginning of this fight?" you ask.\n\n"I don''t know," the girl answers.
    "Maybe he''s trying to mask some other noise?"\n\nYou go further back, until
    the sound of the rock golem''s voice no longer drowns every other sound around
    you. You stop, and try to listen. You can hear a wolf howling far in the distance,
    the gentle rustling of leaves blowing in the wind, and ... footsteps?\n\nYou
    can definitely hear a set of footsteps, now that you''re further away from the
    rock golem. You try to identify the source of the sound, and you notice the grass
    moving unnaturally a few feet behind you.\n\nInvisibility. That''s right. There
    was such a spell. Although you''ve never met someone who could actually use it
    so effectively. If not for the sound, and the look of the grass, you would have
    never guessed anyone was there.\n\nYou aim a jet of water right above the place
    where you saw the grass move, and you knock Holt right out of his invisibility,
    as he hits his head hard on the ground, knocking him unconscious.\n\n"HOLT!"
    you can hear the rock golem bellow in the distance.\n\n"It''s over, Whiskers,"
    you tell the golem in front of you. "Your friend is unconscious, and you can
    barely even stand anymore. Give up."\n\n"Who are you calling Whiskers, you upstart
    wench?" the man says, as he rushes towards you with the last of his strength.\n\nYou
    and the girl charge up one last attack , and release it right before the golem
    reaches you, knocking him back six feet, as he falls to the ground, unconscious,
    and turns back into his human form.\n\nYou attempt to kill the two men with two
    well placed water spears to their throats, but the girl stops you at the very
    last second by burning your spears.\n\n"NO! You can''t kill them!"\n\n '

  text: You decide to take advantage of the element of surprise and go for the kill.
    If this projection you see before you is in fact the last guardian of the girl's
    inner mind, then taking it out now might ensure your success. You go for one
    of your fastest killing techniques, the water whip. You aim your whip directly
    for her neck, swinging it fast enough to decapitate her on the spot. As the whip
    reaches her, she vanishes, and you can see her reappear, several feet behind
    where she was initially.\n\nThe girl puts her hands around her mouth and raises
    her voice, as if the distance between you would actually dampen the sound of
    her voice when the two of you communicate telepathically.\n\n"I'm sorry if I
    offended you by asking your name!" the girl says. "I did not know it was taboo
    in your banshee culture! Can we start over?"\n\nNow you KNOW the girl is making
    fun of you! She even knows that you're a banshee. The fear you had before is
    replaced with pulsating anger. You send off a huge wave of water in her direction
    and try to crush her beneath it. She won't be able to blink away from this. You've
    got her now.\n\nThe girl sees the wave of water and sits there motionless, staring
    at it.  Perhaps she's realized there's no way to get out of its way and has simply
    given up. At the very last moment, when the wave is right in front of her, a
    very large wall of fire appears in front of her that evaporates your entire wave
    into thin air.\n\nOf course... Of course she would have magic as well. You've
    already inhabited her body for 2 weeks. You did not know about this because you've
    been in a dormant state for all this time. Some of your magic power must have
    rubbed off on her, and the magic's nature is attuned to her personality. Fire.
    Out of all the magic powers out there, it had to be fire.\n\nAs the girl sits
    there, smirking, you come to the realization that this fight might not be as
    easy as you originally thought. With her magical powers thrown into the mix,
    she is at least your equal, if not stronger than you, taking into account your
    current exhaustion. Judging from her actions and words thus far, she appears
    to be mainly on the defensive. Perhaps it would be wiser to call a truce for
    now, at least to give you some time to recover?\n\nThe girl calls out to you
    again, with her voice raised like before.\n\n"Come oooon! Don't be like that!
    I said I was sorry!"\n\n

    the cart, but you are finding it incredibly difficult to even stand at this point.
    If only you had practiced your magic or your movement coordination yesterday
    instead of suppressing your magic aura you wouldn''t be in this mess.\n\nTrying
    to dodge any sort of attack at this point would be suicidal. You need to attack
    them first, or you are done for.\n\n"Girl, fire everything you''ve got at them!
    Quick, before they have the time to react!"\n\nThe girl nods at you and she starts
    shooting fireballs at them, while you send a jet of water for each of them. Just
    as your projectiles reach them, the man named Whiskers transforms himself into
    a 9 foot tall rock golem, places himself in front of Holt, and takes your attacks
    head on. Although shaken up a bit, he does not appear to have sustained any serious
    damage.\n\n"We''re not salvaging anything, Holt," says Whiskers in a loud, hoarse
    voice. "That banshee can somehow control fire and water at the same time. I''m
    killing her now, before she pulls some other ace out of her sleeve."\n\nWhiskers
    digs his hands into the ground, and pulls out a huge rock that he throws towards
    you. You try to jump out of the way as quick as you can, but you''re not fast
    enough. The rock was big enough to crush you completely underneath it. Everything
    happened so fast that you barely even had the time to realize you were dead.\n\n '

    Even the light is fading from her conceptual realm. A sinister laughter echoes
    all throughout her inner mind. You had no time to react or to even take a look

    In one last desperate attempt, you try to launch yourself to the air with a jet
    of water, but one of the guards quickly intercepts you and slashes you while
    you raise to the air. You fall on the ground as an intense sharp pain travels
    throughout your entire body.\n\nUnable to move, you watch the guards rush towards
    you to give you the finishing blow. You no longer get the chance to scream, as
    five of the guards impale you with their blades at the same time. The world around
    you starts fading away, as you feel yourself slowly drifting into nothingness.\n\n '

    hand hesitantly. As soon as she does, you grab her, and pull her after you. As
    you exit the body, you feel an intense cold sensation that disappears completely
    once you''re out. You are currently floating 10 feet above your body, with the
    girl''s soul along your side. You now have a clear vision of the two men that
    captured you. Their skin is dark and their heads are bald, while their garments
    could be accurately described as rags with jewels. They must be mercenaries from
    the southern continent. Those kinds of clothes are usually worn as protection
    from the hot desert sun.\n\n"Oh gods, this is so cool!" the girl says. "If I
    climb up, I bet I can see the city of Olmnar!"\n\n"You''re not going anywhere.
    We''re going to sit here and wait until the banshee hunters dump us, so we can
    rejoin the body as soon as possible. I can''t hold this technique indefinitely."\n\nOne
    of the men seems to have noticed something''s wrong, because the cart has stopped,
    and he is now checking the body for signs of life.\n\n"This is all your fault,
    Holt. I should have known you would mess up the paralysis spell."\n\n"I''m telling
    you, I didn''t do anything wrong! I''ve cast the spell dozens of times before
    and nothing like this has ever happened!"\n\n"Well, you couldn''t have picked
    a better moment to screw it up! All of that money, down the drain. Who do you
    think is going to pay us for a dead banshee, Holt, tell me? We may as well leave
    her here. I don''t want her stinking up our cart."\n\n '

  text: '"I don''t think I can control the body well enough at this point. It''s
    better that you take control of the body and we attack the ogre together," you
    tell the girl.\n\n"Alright then! Here I go!" the girl exclaims as she starts
    dashing towards the ogre.\n\nThe ogre roars yet again and smashes his staff against
    the ground. As a result, the earth starts rumbling, and eventually fissuring.
    A wide crack in the ground appears right in front of you, but the girl jumps
    effortlessly to the other side.\n\n"I didn''t know ogres were this strong!" says
    the girl''s projection while moving her hands as if controlling a puppet on strings,
    instead of her own body.\n\n"They''re not," you explain. "He''s using earth magic"\n\n 
    "Oooh. I get it ! So we just need to take that staff away from him, right?" she
    asks rhetorically as she prepares a fireball to throw at the ogre.\n\nThe monster
    sees the girl preparing to attack and hurls a boulder your way in order to interrupt
    her. You intercept his attack by making a geiser erupt right below the boulder
    while in the air, knocking it aside. The girl makes good use of the opening you
    have created for her, and throws the fireball before the ogre can cast another
    spell. The monster tries to block the fireball with his staff, but the force
    of the impact knocks him back, and the staff right out of his hands.\n\nAs the
    girl nears the ogre, she takes his staff right off the ground, and gives a triumphant
    "A-ha!" before she smashes it against the ground, trying to create her own earthquake.\n\n"It
    doesn''t work that way," you let her know. "Only ogres can use those staffs.
    It is completely useless to you."\n\n"Stupid staff!" says the girl with a mixture
    of anger and disappointment as she burns the staff to ashes with her fire magic.
    The ogre gives off a desperate howl and makes a jump for you. You take advantage
    of this, and create a whirlpool right beneath his feet, as he dashes forward.
    As he falls into the whirlpool and gets taken in by the current, the girl throws
    another fireball at him, burning the ogre to a crisp, and evaporating your water.\n\nAs
    the battle ends, the girl smiles triumphantly and says "Ha-haa! We did it! Yay
    us!"\n\nBefore giving you the time to reply, she looks at you and says: "This
    battle really wore me out... I need a nap. Wake me up if you see any more ogres,
    ok?" and almost instantly goes to sleep, as you watch her, incredulous.\n\nYou
    cannot tell if she is being really stupid or really ignorant for going to sleep
    next to a banshee that invaded her own mind and was trying to consume her personality
    just a few moments ago , but even though you know it would bring you great benefit
    to finish her off here and now, you find that you just cannot bring yourself
    to do it.\n\nAs you look at her peaceful expression while sleeping, it dawns
    on you that you have already awakened.  It took you so long to realize it because
    it''s never happened this way before. For some reason, this time you have fused
    with the girl''s soul instead of taking full control of her body. Once the process
    of the awakening is done, it cannot be undone, which means there is no way for
    you to leave the body for a good number of years. If the girl dies, you die with
    her.\n\nIt appears that the two of you will be stuck together for a while.\n\n '

    the trails of magic left behind by banshees. Once they''ve recovered, they''ll

    used to belong to a gang of hoodlums back in Olmnar. I was one of their pickpockets.
    Whenever someone would make an enemy of the gang, they would break their legs
    to teach them a lesson! There are healers in the city of Olmnar. They''ll have
    them fixed in no time once they''ve crawled back to the city!"\n\nYou are currently
    in the middle of nowhere. The two banshee hunters must have deliberately taken
    this roundabout path to the city in order to avoid meeting other people. Carrying
    an unconscious little girl in a cart is suspicious, any way you look at it.\n\nAs
    it stands, if you were to break their legs and leave them here, you would practically
    leave them to their deaths. Slow and agonizing deaths. Crawling all the way to
    the city, or even to the main road with both their legs broken would be pretty
    much impossible. The men would most likely die of thirst or of hunger before
    reaching safety.\n\nYou could spare the two men their suffering by leaving two
    delayed water traps hidden below them when you leave. You''ll make sure the girl
    doesn''t notice, and you''ll just tell her you remembered a special knot that
    can hold the two mages for a few days if you tie them up. The traps will trigger
    to impale them straight through the heart once you''re far enough away to be
    out of hearing range, granting them a quick, painless death.\n\nThere is also
    a way you could leave the two men alive without them following you any time soon.
    You''ve once learned a technique that could mess with a person''s magic sense
    temporarily, by applying pressure to certain key points of their body. This would
    keep them out of your hair for at least a few days. You would likely have to
    confront them again at a later date, however.\n\n '

  text: You decide to answer the girl's question and buy some time in order to find
    out just what exactly is happening.\n\n"I have no name. I am a banshee," you
    explain to her.\n\nThe girl sits there and blinks at you with a puzzled expression
    on her face.\n\n"How can you not have a name?" she asks. "What do people call
    you if you don't have a name?"\n\n"People don't call me anything," you tell her,
    bluntly. "I never talk to them."\n\nThe girl appears shocked. "But then, don't
    you feel lonely?" she asks you, concerned.\n\nLonely. Is this supposed to be
    a human thing?\n\n"I don't know what that means." you tell her, starting to get
    annoyed. The girl mistakes your statement for an invitation to explain the term
    to you.\n\n"Loneliness is that feeling you have when you have no one to talk
    to when you're sad, and no one to help you when you're in trouble."\n\nUninterested
    to hear a thesis about the unnatural human need for socialization, you interrupt
    the girl to ask her about something a bit more relevant to your situation.\n\n"How
    are you here?" you ask the girl.\n\n"Pardon?"\n\n"How are you here, in this place?
    You shouldn't be able to materialize here."\n\n"This is my own mind. Where else
    would I be?"\n\n"This is not what I'm asking.  I've done this possession thing
    dozens of times before, and I've never encountered any sort of resistance. You
    almost had me dragged out of your mind, and then you appeared here, in front
    of me, like it's perfectly normal."\n\n"I'm sorry you almost got dragged out...
    It wasn't intentional."\n\nShe pauses.\n\n"You are the one that gave me all these
    magic powers aren't you? You are the cause for all of these fire powers that
    I suddenly started having..."\n\nMagic?... Of course... Of course she would have
    magic as well. You've already inhabited her body for 2 weeks. You did not know
    about this because you've been in a dormant state for all this time. Some of
    your magic power must have rubbed off on her, and the magic's nature is attuned
    to her personality. Fire. Out of all the magic powers out there, it had to be
    fire. It's a good thing you didn't start a fight not knowing this. It could have
    proved fatal.\n\n"Your magic is... a side effect, of me invading your mind. You
    have magic because I have magic. Although my magic is water. The fact that you
    can control fire and not water is probably a result of you having a different
    personality than mine. Water users are usually more calm and rational, whereas
    fire users tend to be more short-tempered and energetic.\n\nThe girl grins.\n\n"I
    think we need to continue our conversation some other time," she interjects.\n\n

    your acrobatic skills really are."\n\nThe girl looks happy to be given such a
    task.\n\n"You can count on me, Petal!"\n\nShe starts running around the golem,
    shooting flames high and low, left and right, trying to overwhelm him. The golem
    rushes towards her with a lot more speed than you would have expected from a
    creature of this size, but the girl effortlessly skips and jumps away from all
    of his attacks, while shooting some more fireballs his way.\n\nYou join the girl
    in bombarding the golem with spells from every direction, while summoning a few
    pillars of water between you and him to serve as distractions. The golem is shouting
    after you constantly with his very loud voice, drowning all other sound around
    you. He seems to be getting more and more tired, as his movements have gotten
    a lot slower than they were at the beginning.\n\n"I think it''s about time we
    finish him off, don''t you think?" you ask the girl.\n\n"Not yet," she answers.
    "I don''t see the other mage, Holt, anywhere."\n\nYou realize she is correct.
    You haven''t seen Holt either, since you started rushing towards his golem friend.\n\n"He
    must have run away at the first sight of danger and left his companion here to
    die," you tell the girl. "His own friend called him useless on several occasions."\n\n"Yes,
    but what if he''s hiding, and waiting for the right moment to lounge at us?"\n\nYou
    look around you. You are in an open field of level ground, with the only trees
    visible being a few miles in the distance. There are no places to hide, yet Holt
    is nowhere in sight. The rock golem is  breathing very heavily now, but he still
    keeps shouting after you.\n\n '

    moving around as much as possible in order to both tire him out, and to make
    it harder for Holt to aim for you while invisible.\n\nAfter a few minutes of
    running circles around Whiskers, he starts to get visibly tired. Unfortunately,
    none of your attacks are powerful enough to finish him off directly. You''ll
    need to sit still for a few seconds to charge up a bigger attack. This is likely
    when Holt will make his move.\n\n"Girl, let''s charge up one final attack to
    finish off the golem. But keep your guard up. This is likely when Holt will make
    his move."\n\nThe two of you start charging up a big fire and water beam to shoot
    towards the golem, while he makes a run towards you. Just before you get to release
    the beam, you hear Holt''s voice behind you. "Paralysis."\n\nYou jump out of
    the spell''s way right at the last second, but due to the movement coordination
    problems between you and the girl, you sprained an ankle in doing so.\n\n"I''m
    not taking any more risks," says Whiskers. "I''m finishing her off now."\n\nThe
    rock golem throws a huge boulder towards you. You try to get out of its way,
    but the sprained ankle is holding you back. You aren''t fast enough. You end
    up crushed beneath the boulder. It all ended so fast that you barely even had
    the chance to realize you were dead.\n\n '

    in the distance.\n\n"Girl, be quiet!"\n\n"My name is Flower, not girl!" the girl
    objects.\n\n"Silence!" you repeat yourself.\n\n"We''re inside my mind. Nobody
    can hear us."\n\n"Damnit, girl! I''m trying to listen--"\n\nThe noise has now
    grown considerably louder. It sounds like... a carriage? With perhaps a handful
    of guards marching alongside it? Luckily, you are well hidden inside the forest,
    so there''s no danger of being noticed.\n\n The girl seems to have heard the
    noise as well, as she is now clapping her hands like an idiot, looking very excited.\n\n"A
    travelling merchant," she exclaims. "And just in time, I was so hungry! Come
    on, Petal! I still have a few coins so we can get a good meal," the girl says,
    as she rushes outside the forest and towards the road.\n\n"You fool! Wait--"
    you yell at the girl as you try to take control of the body. You''re too late.
    You can''t take control of the body in time and the girl has already reached
    the carriage. There are a lot more guards here than you expected.\n\nUnknowing
    of the disaster she''s caused, the girl is giving the merchant a list of the
    food she wants to buy. The merchant looks utterly terrified. He manages to pull
    himself together and shout to his guards: "Kill her! Kill the banshee! Now!"\n\nThe
    girl appears shocked, and is just standing there like a lemon. You need to act,
    and quick.\n\nThe guards are already moving to surround you. You need to decide
    whether you should try to get some distance between you and them and avoid being
    surrounded, or whether you should start directly attacking them with your water
    magic.\n\n\n\n '

    the place where you''ve encountered the caravan. You practice acrobatic movement
    and taking control of the body, in turns, for the remainder of the day, and half
    of the night.  The girl is impressively light on her feet, and seems to have
    successfully regained most of her former agility through today''s training session.
    You''ve also gotten a lot better at sharing control of the body, so there shouldn''t
    be any more awkward movements, when one of you tries to quickly gain control.\n\nAll
    of that hard training has left the both of you exhausted, so you decide it is
    time to call it a day. You cast a rudimentary movement detection spell to awake
    you in case monsters approach your location, and you go to sleep in a nearby

    you carefully plant your two water traps below the banshee hunters. Arraka, who''s
    known you for a number of years, immediately understood what you were doing and

    you: "Will they be ok?"\n\n"Of course they will," you answer her. "Those knots
    are designed to be a nuisance, not impossible to untie. They''ll figure it out,
    eventually."\n\nAs you head into the forest, you take one last look back towards
    the two banshee hunters, and then leave them to their fate. Once you''re far
    enough away from the place where you fought the banshee hunters, you turn towards
    the girl.\n\n"There is an elixir we can drink to avoid being tracked by banshee
    hunters. I used it quite often, back when I possessed my last human."\n\nYour
    head starts spinning. The recent events have left you very tired, and you''ve
    barely managed to sleep before you got captured.\n\n"We''ll discuss this at a
    later time, though. For now, I need to sleep. Can you keep watch? I don''t want
    any more surprises this time around."\n\n"Sure thing, Petal!"\n\nYou never realized
    how tired you really were until you closed your eyes. As you lay down, you fall
    asleep almost instantly.\n\n '

    any more surprises this time around."\n\n"Sure thing, Petal!"\n\nYou never realized
    how tired you really were until you closed your eyes. As you lay down, you fall
    asleep almost instantly.\n\n '

  text: '"Why do we need to get closer to them, girl?"\n\n"...We need to get closer
    so that we can attack them," she answers finally.\n\n"You''re not making any
    sense. In fact, you''re making even less sense than usual."\n\nYou pause for
    a second.\n\n"And since when do YOU call me banshee?"\n\nThe girl, looks at you,
    expressionless, but says nothing.\n\nSomething''s wrong. She''s acting... different.
    You look at the two robed men. None of them has made any move since they made
    the dragon illusion. What are they waiting for?\n\nThen it hits you.\n\n"Girl.
    Tell me your name."\n\n"What?"\n\n"Your name, girl. What is your name?"\n\n"I
    already told you my name."\n\n"Did you, now? I wasn''t listening. Say it again."\n\n"My
    NAME is..." she stops. "My name...is..."\n\nThe look in her eyes is changing
    rapidly. It goes from the blank stare she had, to a look of intense concentration,
    then shock, comprehension, and finally, rage.\n\n"Those BASTARDS," she shouts,
    her eyes turning crimson red, as she fires a huge ray of fire straight through
    the illusory dragon and right towards the man holding the disc.\n\nThe man with
    the scythes manages to block the attack, but only barely, and they both get thrown
    back into the carriage by the force of the blast. The impact of their fall made
    something fall from the back of the carriage, but nobody seemed to notice, except
    you.\n\n"What the hell did you do?" asks Imnir, the man with the scythes, as
    he conjures a very strong magical shield in front of him. " Weren''t you supposed
    to use suggestion magic on her?"\n\n"I did..." says the other mage, Zalmog, dumbfounded.
    "She was supposed to rush right towards us. I do not understand. This magic is
    infallible. It has worked every single time I''ve used it, without exception.
    You know this as well as I do. Our combination of spells has never failed."\n\n"Yeah?
    Well, who did you cast it on? The girl? Or the banshee?"\n\nZalmog doesn''t answer.
    In the meantime, the girl is furiously shooting fireballs towards the two men,
    but isn''t able to penetrate their magical shield.\n\n"Yeah, that''s what I thought,"
    says Imnir. "I''m not fighting them without our foolproof combo, even if we might
    easily beat them in a fair fight. We can''t take even the slightest risk. Our
    cargo is too important."\n\n"But the guards..."\n\n"Leave the wretches behind.
    They deserve their fate for not being able to handle a small child."\n\nWith
    these last words, the man with the scythes starts the carriage, and they quickly
    make themselves scarce, as the girl tries to run after them.\n\n"Stop it, girl.
    They''re gone. Leave them be."\n\nThe girl''s eyes turn back to their normal
    green color, as she starts to calm down, slowly.\n\nShe looks back at you.\n\n"How
    did you manage to wake me up? I thought you only knew water magic."\n\n"Water
    magic and rudimentary spells, yes. But most mind affecting spells can be easily
    countered with non magical means, as long as there''s some external influence.
    For suggestion magic, all you have to do is make the target think of something
    other than the idea they''ve been suggested. That''s why I kept asking you your
    name."\n\n"Ooooooh! I am so angry! I swear I''m going to hunt them down for this!"\n\nYou
    remember the cargo that fell from the back of the carriage. Using it as bait
    could easily make the two mages come to you, without any sort of effort on your
    part. Plus, the cargo might turn out to be some very valuable artifact. But do
    you really want to make enemies of those powerful mages, and whatever crazy sect
    that hawk and sun emblem belonged to?\n\n '

    spot, far away from the place where you''ve encountered the caravan. You focus
    on improving your magic for the remainder of the day, and half of the night.
    You managed to not only cast water armor, which you''ll be wearing permanently,
    just in case, but also your water whip, (jet) and you''ve also tested a technique
    that launches you high up in the air with two water jets bursting from your hands,
    and then using two more jets to slow down your landing. This technique could
    prove very useful if you ever need a quick escape plan. (jet)  You''ve also managed
    to heighten your magic senses and increase your magical power, through practice,
    which will not only increase the strength of your water and fire spells, but
    also of other types of spells.\n\nAll of that hard training has left the both
    of you exhausted, so you decide it is time to call it a day. You cast a rudimentary
    movement detection spell to awake you in case monsters approach your location,

  text: '"Let''s find some shelter," you tell the girl.\n\n"But... what about those
    banshee hunters? Shouldn''t we hunt them down?"\n\n"No. Let them come to us.
    This time, we''ll be waiting."\n\nYou and the girl start heading towards the
    forest, in order to find a new shelter.\n\nAfter a few hours of walking, there''s
    still no sign of the two banshee hunters. Have they simply abandoned their hunt?
    No, that can''t be right. Their magic senses should have alerted them the moment
    you got up from the ground, and you didn''t leave them time to get very far away.\n\nThey
    must be somewhere, hiding. Waiting for you to lower your guard.\n\n"Girl, let''s
    rest here for a bit."\n\nYou stop in a small clearing. There are no trees or
    other hiding spots around that could be used to ambush you, as far as you can
    tell. You go to drink some water from a river flowing nearby.\n\nSomething is
    wrong. You can feel it. Suddenly, you hear a small twig cracking right behind
    you. You turn around immediately, but you see nothing. You look at the broken
    twig on the ground, yet you do not see what could have broken it. As you keep
    staring at the twig, you start noticing that the grass around it is unnaturally
    flat. It is as if a force is pushing the grass around it towards the ground.
    Kind of like what would happen if someone were standing on it.\n\nInvisibility.
    That''s right. There was such a spell. Although you''ve never met someone who
    could actually use it so effectively. If not for the sound, and the look of the
    grass, you would have never guessed anyone was there.\n\n '

  text: 'Before you get the chance to attack, the banshee hunter that was invisible
    appears right in front of you, and casts a paralysis spell towards you. You manage
    to jump out of its way, but before you even get to land, the mage throws a dagger
    towards you, that hits you right in the chest. Since you''ve been wearing your
    water armor ever since you learned it last night, the dagger simply bounced off
    of you and fell on the ground.\n\nAs soon as you get back to your feet, you hit
    the mage with a powerful jet of water. He blocks it by holding two daggers in
    front of him, but gets thrown to the ground by the force of the impact. The other
    banshee hunter makes his appearance from behind the trees.\n\n"Holt!" he yells.
    " You were supposed to paralyze her!"\n\n"Shut up, Whiskers. She heard me before
    I could get close enough to hit her with the spell."\n\n"Only a parlor trick
    magician like you could make a deadly spell like invisibility seem so useless.
    And stop calling me Whiskers!"\n\nYou and the girl take advantage of their bickering
    to launch an all out attack against them. Just in time, the banshee hunter named
    Whiskers transforms himself into a 9 foot tall rock golem, places himself in
    front of Holt, and takes your attacks head on. He appears to have taken quite
    a bit of damage, but he didn''t budge from his position.\n\nYou realize that
    you''ve once again lost sight of Holt, while his friend provided him cover. He
    must have turned invisible again. You try to look around and see where the grass
    is moving oddly, but Whiskers is determined to keep your attention focused on
    him. He is continuously dashing towards you in golem form, and is shouting very
    loudly, in order to cover the sound of his friend''s footsteps.\n\nThere''s no
    way to concentrate enough to find Holt through his invisibility while his golem
    friend is making this much effort to distract you. As it stands, you might be
    forced to play their game and fight the golem first, in order to be able to find
    his friend afterwards.\n\nYou suddenly remember that since you did your magic
    training yesterday, you also have a second option available. You could use a
    long water whip to do a fast swipe all around you. That would have a great chance
    of hitting Holt, if he''s anywhere around you, which would also knock him out
    of his invisibility.\n\n '

  text: 'A pillar of flame and water? Just what kind of nonsense is this girl babbling
    about? You then realize you haven''t checked the outside world for quite a while.
    As you direct your consciousness towards the real world, you see that the girl
    was not lying.\n\nThe girl''s body is floating in the air, with her feet a few
    centimeters above the ground, her hair raised as if there is a source of wind
    right beneath her, her eyes bright yellow, and a very tall spinning pillar of
    fire and water surrounding her. This is surely a side effect of the Awakening
    not going exactly according to plan.\n\nSomething this tall and unordinary is
    sure to catch a lot of unwanted attention. You concentrate on making the pillar
    disappear, but you find that it''s not as easy as it looks.\n\n"Here, I''ll help!"
    the girl says, cheerfully, as she starts to concentrate her magic towards the
    outside. You pause for a little, and then decide to join the girl in concentrating
    your magic towards the outside world, and together you manage to stop the pillar
    and get the girl''s body back to its normal state.\n\nJust as you finish, you
    start hearing noise coming from the woods. Soon after, a few dozens of trolls
    and goblins start emerging one by one from behind the trees. Towering above them
    all, a hideous creature holding a magic staff announces its presence with a bellowing
    roar. An ogre magi.\n\nThe ogre is far more dangerous than all of the goblins
    and trolls combined. Leaving aside its size and strength, the fact that it can
    cast magic is what worries you the most. You look back to see what is the girl''s
    reaction to all of this. You catch her in the middle of some stretching exercises.
    As she finishes up, she puts on a confident grin and says: "I''ll take care of
    the trolls. I know fire will stop them from healing. You take care of the goblins.
    We can deal with the ogre afterwards!"\n\nAs much as you hate taking orders from
    a little kid, her logic is sound, and her plan is exactly what you were about
    to propose, before she beat you to it.\n\n"Very well, then," you answer. "Let''s
    take them all out in a single attack."\n\n"Aye, aye, sir!" says the girl, visibly
    happy to have your approval.\n\nYou start attacking the goblins. At first, you
    try to make a huge wave of water to wash them all away, but then you realize
    that your magic is nowhere near as strong here as it is in the conceptual realm.
    Every time you possess a new body it''s the same. It takes a long while for the
    magic to accommodate with your new host. You start attacking them with a rain
    of water arrows.\n\nAs promised, all of the goblins drop dead from your first
    attack, without any chance at retaliation. Looking to your left, it would appear
    the girl has also upheld her end of the bargain, all of the trolls being killed
    off by a single volley of her fire arrows.\n\nAs you try to move forward, towards
    the ogre, you realize that both you and the girl tried to control the body at
    the same time, resulting in a very awkward movement, ending with the girl falling
    flat on her face.  The girl''s projection inside her mind is now laughing hysterically,
    unable to contain herself.\n\nThe ogre magi is looking very confused. At least
    that little stunt postponed his attack for a while. This shared control of the
    body is not going to cut it. You''ll have to decide which one of you takes control
    of the body, and quick. As if reading your mind, the girl brings forward a suggestion.\n\n"I
    could try and summon a fire wolf to help us. It will take me some time though,
    and you''ll need to control the body in the meantime," she says.\n\nHer plan
    might work, but you are not used to controlling the girl''s movements, and are
    unsure if you could hold the ogre off by yourself long enough for the girl to
    finish her summoning. Alternatively, you could just leave the body''s control
    to the girl, and try to take the ogre down together. Both plans have their faults,
    and you can''t tell which one would give you a better chance of success.\n\n'

    the time to recover."\n\nYou realize you''ll need to use stronger magic than
    what you''ve used until now to knock out a creature of that size.\n\n"Girl, the
    golem can barely move at this point. Let''s just channel a very strong attack
    towards him together, at the same time. He shouldn''t be able to dodge it in
    time."\n\n"Alright!"\n\nThe two of you stop moving, and start concentrating on
    channeling your magic into one big final attack. Whiskers, the golem can barely
    form a sentence anymore because of his heavy breathing, but he still hasn''t
    stopped shouting at you. He''s been doing it ever since the fight started.\n\n"GET
    BACK HERE.... AND ... FIGHT ME!"\n\nAs the two of you prepare to fire off your
    attack, you hear a familiar voice from behind you.\n\n"Paralysis," you hear Holt
    say, as he appears from thin air, right behind you.\n\nYou drop to the floor
    almost instantly. But something is wrong. It''s not just your movements that
    are paralyzed this time. You can''t even breathe. You try desperately to gasp
    for air, but none of your muscles are responding.\n\n"Holt, you incredible idiot!
    I can''t believe I went through all that trouble to distract her just for you
    to cast paralysis from point blank range. Don''t you know paralysis can kill
    people when cast that close?"\n\nHe transforms back into his human form and approaches
    you, as you are still trying in vain to gasp for breath.\n\n"Look at this, Holt.
    It''s over. You killed her. She''s not even breathing anymore. Say goodbye to
    our hard earned money. I swear, one of these days I''m going to..."\n\nYour consciousness
    starts fading away as you die, suffocated. The last thing you hear is the sound
    of Whiskers and Holt, still bickering.\n\n '

  text: 'You should have known this cooperation of yours could not last long. If
    it''s a war she wants, then a war she''ll have. You quickly summon a few dozen
    water lances inside the girl''s mind and send them raining from above, hoping
    to catch her by surprise. Instead, she just casually teleports right out of range
    and gives you her signature nonchalant grin.\n\nThat thrice damned teleportation!
    You remind yourself that you are at a disadvantage here. This is after all her
    own mind. Already, you can see the room you were in morph into some sort of medieval
    arena, to go along with your battle.\n\nAs you pause to think what tactics you
    should use, one of the guards, that was apparently not truly knocked out, quickly
    lounges towards you in an attempt to behead you as your back is turned. His helmet
    had fallen off when he''d been knocked over, so you try to finish him off for
    good this time, with a water dagger to his head, but the girl yet again evaporates
    it before you even get to throw it.\n\n"NO!" you shout as the guard quickly slashes
    his sword towards your neck.\n\nAt the very last second, the girl shows an incredible
    display of acrobatic skill, as she very nearly dodges the lethal blow, jumps
    back with a triple back handspring, and lands elegantly on her feet. Just as
    she lands, she sends a fireball rushing towards the attacker, knocking him out
    for good this time.\n\nThe girl gives you one of her widest grins thus far, and
    says :"Te-hee! You should have seen your face! Bet you didn''t expect I was ever
    in the circus?"\n\nYou did not, although the ridiculous clothes she''s wearing
    on the outside should have been a dead giveaway. While in her inner mind the
    girl is wearing a red dress that matches her red hair, her real body is wearing
    large pants commonly worn by clowns, a gray sleeveless shirt, and no shoes.\n\n"I
    can''t see my damn face, and neither can you. Banshees don''t have faces."\n\nThe
    girl interrupts your speech by putting a mirror in front of you. You are shocked
    to see that, looking back at you is the face of a woman somewhere in her early
    twenties, with blue eyes and hair. Did this human appearance come as a result
    of your soul being linked with the girl''s? Or is it just how you took form because
    the girl imagined you this way, in the same way the room took form around you
    earlier?\n\nYou are losing focus. What is important now is whether you should
    continue capturing the caravan, or whether you should retreat now, before something
    else unexpected happens. Fighting the girl is just a waste of time and effort.\n\n '

  text: 'Fine. Forget the guards! Just head for the carriage, quick, before they
    make a run for it," you tell the girl.\n\n"Right behind you, Petal!" she answers
    you.\n\nOptional(Just as you finish talking, one of the guards who was only pretending
    to be knocked out tries to stab you while your back is turned. You quickly fire
    a powerful jet of water towards him, knocking him out for good this time. You
    give the girl an accusatory look, and continue on your way.)\n\nAs you approach
    the carriage and the merchant who seems to be just about ready to faint, two
    men step out to see what the commotion is about. They are both wearing dark blue
    robes, and on their chests, they''re each wearing a brooch that appears to picture
    a hawk holding the sun in its talons. One of the men is holding a large disc
    with an emerald in the middle, while the other is holding two scythes, both of
    them encrusted with large sapphires.\n\nSuddenly, your survival instincts start
    going completely crazy. Every fiber in your being is telling you to get as far
    away from these men as possible. Are they really that powerful?\n\n"What''s happening
    out here?" asks the man holding the scythes. "Why hasn''t this banshee been captured,
    yet?"\n\n"C-Captured?" the merchant answered, visibly still frightened. "I ordered
    my guards to kill her!"\n\n"And they''ve done a marvelous job at that."\n\nThe
    man with the scythes turns to you.\n\n"Surrender, banshee, and you''ll get to
    live.  Surely you must have felt the gap between our powers when you first gazed
    upon us. You are no match for us. Survival is after all the only thing your kin
    is interested in, is it not?"\n\nHe is not wrong. But you are no fool, either.
    You''ve always considered surrendering to be a stupid course of action. You''d
    much rather fight against all odds than risk putting your life in the hands of
    an enemy.\n\n"Watch your tongue, simpleton, or watch it get sliced."\n\n"I''m
    not a banshee, stupid, I''m a human girl!"\n\nSeeing the shock on the man''s
    face, you realize the both of you must have somehow spoken the phrases at the
    same time, in different voices.\n\n"What... did you say? Zalmog, did you just
    hear that? Could it be that there''s... two of them in there?"\n\n"Pay her no
    heed, Imnir. She''s just trying to distract you," the other man says, as he holds
    his emerald encrusted disc in front of you.\n\nAll of a sudden, a fairly large
    dragon appears out of nowhere and positions himself between you and the two robed
    men.\n\n"Pay no attention to the dragon," you tell the girl. "It''s just an illusion.
    And a very poor one, at that."\n\nThe girl is just standing there, with a spaced
    out look again. Is she planning to do this every time you have a major battle?\n\nThe
    girl suddenly gets a very serious look on her face and looks you straight in
    the eye.\n\n"Banshee," she says. "I think I know how to beat these guys."\n\n"Is...
    that so?"\n\n"They won''t expect us to attack them head on with that dragon between
    us. Let''s rush towards them, and straight through the dragon illusion. We can
    knock them both out while they''re confused."\n\nShe is eyeing you intently.
    She seems very convinced her plan will work.\n\n '

  text: '"Something''s not right," you tell the girl. "Holt couldn''t have escaped
    in such a short time, yet he''s nowhere to be seen. Let''s back up for a bit."\n\nAs
    you back up, Whiskers is still shouting at you and tries to follow you, but he
    can barely move anymore.\n\n"And why has this buffoon been shouting at us ever
    since the beginning of this fight?" you ask.\n\n"I don''t know," the girl answers.
    "Maybe he''s trying to mask some other noise?"\n\nYou go further back, until
    the sound of the rock golem''s voice no longer drowns every other sound around
    you. You stop, and try to listen. You can hear a wolf howling far in the distance,
    the gentle rustling of leaves blowing in the wind, and ... footsteps?\n\nYou
    can definitely hear a set of footsteps, now that you''re further away from the
    rock golem. You try to identify the source of the sound, and you notice the grass
    moving unnaturally a few feet behind you.\n\nInvisibility. That''s right. There
    was such a spell. Although you''ve never met someone who could actually use it
    so effectively. If not for the sound, and the look of the grass, you would have
    never guessed anyone was there.\n\nYou aim a jet of water right above the place
    where you saw the grass move, and you knock Holt right out of his invisibility,
    as he hits his head hard on the ground, knocking him unconscious.\n\n"HOLT!"
    you can hear the rock golem bellow in the distance.\n\n"It''s over, Whiskers,"
    you tell the golem in front of you. "Your friend is unconscious, and you can
    barely even stand anymore. Give up."\n\n"Who are you calling Whiskers, you upstart
    wench?" the man says, as he rushes towards you with the last of his strength.\n\nYou
    and the girl charge up one last attack , and release it right before the golem
    reaches you, knocking him back six feet, as he falls to the ground, unconscious,
    and turns back into his human form.\n\nYou attempt to kill the two men with two
    well placed water spears to their throats, but the girl stops you at the very
    last second by burning your spears.\n\n"NO! You can''t kill them!"\n\n '
