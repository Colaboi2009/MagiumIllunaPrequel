You are a banshee. A being of pure magic. A spirit that needs to inhabit other beings' bodies to survive. Over the years, you've taken control of countless animals and humans, and left their bodies as they died, only to take control of the next one... and then the next one. Over and over again, for decades. Always hunted by humans. Always on the run.  For as long as you've existed you've only cared about surviving, and your water magic has been your only true ally.\n\n
For the past two weeks, you've inhabited the body of a 9 year old human girl. It is now time to fully take control of her body and consume her personality, in a process that humans have come to call "The banshee awakening". It is not something you enjoy doing, but it is something that has to be done. It is the only way to keep surviving. With humans especially, it is a matter of "kill or be killed". You dwell no longer on this topic and start your way towards the girl's inner mind, the very center of her being.\n\n
You notice something is different this time from the hundreds of times you've done it in the past. It feels like you are swimming against a current, a very strong current, instead of flying through a slight breeze.  As you get closer to your destination, the current grows exponentially stronger. It is now becoming very difficult to even hold your ground, let alone move forward. This has never happened before.\n\n
You start panicking. You can't afford to get thrown out of the body now... There's just no way you'll be able to find another host in time. You'll simply fade into non-existence. The mere thought terrifies you. You try to muster every little ounce of energy that you have left in order to reach the center of the inner mind. It is no use. The current has swallowed you and you no longer have the force to fight back. You are being dragged towards the outside at a very rapid pace. As you feel like you're about to be thrown out of the body, a hand reaches out to you and pulls you back in.  You notice the current has suddenly stopped.\n\n
A smiling, cheerful face beams at you as you struggle back to your feet. You realize it is the face of the very girl you possessed. A sudden feeling of fear and terror engulfs you. Why did she pull you out of the current? Does she plan to finish you off here and now and make sure you never possess anyone ever again?  How did she even manage to materialize herself inside her own mind like this? What kind of superhuman willpower has allowed her to fight a banshee within her own mind?\n\n
As you stand there, frozen, the girl shows you a big grin and says: "Phew. That was a close one! I thought I lost you there. I'm Flower, by the way! Nice to meet you! What's your name?"\n\n
You are unsure how to react to this. The niceness in her tone has taken you aback. Does she not know what she's dealing with? Or is this some sort of ploy to get you to lower your guard?  You can't afford to take the risk. As you have learned in the past, humans can be very clever, and are masters of deception, even at such a young age. You think about what your options are, at this point.\n\n
One option would be to attack her in the hopes you can catch her off guard. Your water magic should make short work of her even in the tired state you are now, and your magic should work well enough even in this conceptual realm you find yourself in. Another option would be to try stalling her by answering her question, while trying to find a way to get out of this situation alive. Finally you could try fleeing. Even as desperate as this might seem to you now, it might be the better option. After all, you have absolutely no idea what you are dealing with.\n\n
